# LSTM

Project [WIP]


## I. Description:
---------
Talkative Bot : a bot trying to be creative.
You can find me at : https://twitter.com/TheTalkativeBot

How do I work? Post a picture in comments of one of my tweets and I will tell you what your picture evokes to me :)

(In order to avoid flooding, I will need to follow you otherwise I won't answer you!)

## II. Requirements:
- python 2.7
- cuda toolkit & cudnn
- tensorflow (cpu or gpu)
- keras
- opencv
- demjson
- python-twitter library

Files for image_captionning's model such as weights and pre-trained models can't be store in Github because of their size, I will try to find a way to store them elsewhere and make them available to download.

## III. Runk
- src/main.py

## IV. Description:
- 01-scrapers contains notebooks about the scrapers and downloader from FTP.
- 02-train_LSTM contains notebooks for the trainings ofc differents LSTM models (in French, English, German, etc.)
- 03-image_captionning contains notebooks for the training of the Image caption model.
- 04-twitter_bot contains a notebook on how to use the Twitter API to automate actions.
- src folder contains the script files necessary to run the bot.
