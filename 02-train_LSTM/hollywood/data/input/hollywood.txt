                      To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need
                      something substantial. A bait. In the
                      Justice Department, we have this mission
                      statement... We decide who the target is,
                      what's the threat assessment, the cost
                      value, over what time table it's gonna
                      take place... Which target do we go after
                      first. We don't want to miss a big target
                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve
                      their lives.

                      separates him from those we're going to
                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something
                      continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of
                      much help.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the

                      someone lobbying at a state level, as
                      well as in Washington. My organization
                      can provide both. We've got contacts that
                      you don't have and other people can't
                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have
                      multiple businesses... However you need
                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
                      stay coordinated and all transactions and
                      contracts are realized. I am that person,
                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

            Long-Hair looks up.

            A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.
            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing
            LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.
            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

            He lights a cigarette and sits down in a re-upholstered lazy
            boy where a TATTOO ARTIST is setting up... 

            Catfish proffers his forearm, displaying a row of notches
            (kills). And Tattoo Artist begins to outline two more...

            Artist drops dead on the floor.

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:

                      up with strychnine? How he died slow
                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

            Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin:

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

            With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse
            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose.

<b>            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT
</b>
            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING
<b>            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...
</b>
<b>            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.
</b>
            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

<b>            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS
</b><b>            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 
</b>
            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the
            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,
<b>            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
</b><b>            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.
</b>
            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to
            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over
            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.
            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes
            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and
            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.
            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on
            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian
            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,
            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at
            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the
            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of
            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on
            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.
            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

<b>          
</b>          JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
          beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
          hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
          pain beyond his years.

</b>                     They can fix a spinal, if you've got the
                     money. But not on vet benefits, not in
                     this economy.
<b>          
</b>          The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
          crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
          wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
          LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
          isolated souls.

          other, and so on.
<b>          
</b>          His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
          arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A "Born Loser"

</b>          We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
          wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
          forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
          CLAP and WHOOP.

<b>          
</b>          Jake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
          the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
          Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his
          fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away.

                    does a damn thing.
<b>          
</b>          Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
          down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
<b>          
</b>          The chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and --

</b>          MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4

          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
          the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.

          forward and pivots smoothly.

</b>          He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
          the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
          a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
          He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
          of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.

          hefts it like an assault rifle.

</b>          The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the
          sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
          cyan gloom.
<b>          
</b>          POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
          move warily through the forest.
<b>          
</b>          ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
<b>          
</b>          DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
          him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
          GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
<b>          
</b>          She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
          and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
          for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
          name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
<b>          
</b>          Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
          she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
          JAKE. Utterly silent.
<b>          
</b>          Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
<b>          THROAT.
</b><b>          
</b>          ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
          for the shot --
<b>          
</b>          -- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She
          hesitates.
<b>          
</b>          RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
          WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
          dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
          CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
          glows faintly in the dark shadows.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The
          woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.

<b>          
</b>          Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
          grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
          a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
<b>          
</b>          Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
          black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
<b>          
</b>          TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
          around the butt end of the spear.
<b>          
</b>          ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
          the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
<b>          
</b>          A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
<b>          
</b>          The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
          leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail.
<b>          
</b>          Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
          Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
          SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
<b>          
</b>          He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.   Another on
          his opposite flank.
<b>          
</b>          Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
<b>          
</b>          The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
          They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
          steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk --
<b>          
</b>          -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
          GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
          viperwolves have him encircled.
<b>          
</b>          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
          his legs from behind but --
<b>          
</b>          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes
          past, but ANOTHER moves in --
<b>          
</b>          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
          retreating, baring its fangs.
<b>          
</b>          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
<b>          
</b>          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls
          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
<b>          
</b>          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE

<b>          
</b>          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
<b>          
</b>          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
          true, but --
<b>          
</b>          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
<b>          
</b>          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
<b>          
</b>          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>

          just as --
<b>          
</b>          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
<b>          
</b>          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it
          off in time to see --
<b>          
</b>          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
          wolf falls.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf.
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
<b>          
</b>          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
<b>          
</b>          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
          but --
<b>          
</b>          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
<b>          
</b>          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
<b>          
</b>          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
<b>          
</b>          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
<b>          
</b><b>                                 NEYTIRI
</b>                    Raaaarrrr!
<b>          
</b>          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
          and looks up at --
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
          over, she turns.
<b>          
</b>          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE

</b><b>                                                                       39.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
          is transformed.
<b>          
</b>          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
<b>          
</b>          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --
<b>          
</b>          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
          chest.
<b>

                    Forgive me, my brother.
<b>          
</b>          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
          the arrow from its heart.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE

          animal.

<b>          
</b>          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.

</b>          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.

</b>          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised
          that he made it.

<b>          
</b>          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
          silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
          feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
          night flyers.

</b>          A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops
          the spear and almost falls off the root.

</b>          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.

          through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
          toward Jake and Neytiri.

</b>          NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --

</b>          More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him.
<b>          
</b>          Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
          he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
          all over his arms, hands, body.

</b>          Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --

</b>          Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which
          reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green

          footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch
          down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
<b>

          like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.

</b>          Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.

</b>          SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root
          and crashes into the foliage below.

</b>          JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --

</b>          SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding

          command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.

</b>          Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with

          sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
          meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
          largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.

</b><b>          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT

</b>          An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the

          mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
<b>          
</b>          They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
          outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
          him.
<b>          
</b>          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery -- a living cathedral.
<b>

          fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.

          other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like

</b>          NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of

<b>          
</b>          It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the

<b>          
</b>          Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
          Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the

          power climb.

</b>          Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
          HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
<b>          
</b>          Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
          watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a

</b>          NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by

</b>          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
<b>          
</b>          She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them
          through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
          Jake sees --

</b>          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.

</b>          Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes

          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
<b>          
</b>          The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK
          and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing

          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
<b>          
</b>          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong

          rock and almost goes over the edge as --

</b>          NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.
<b>          
</b>          The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
          pissed off now, but --

</b>          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN
          HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
          pinning it and --
<b>          
</b>          Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --

</b>          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
          and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals
          "follow me" and DIVES.

          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
          Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
<b>

<b>

          into sunlight.
<b>          
</b>          Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,
          then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back.
          He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.

          take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
<b>

          She points and Jake sees --

</b>          A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
          rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the

          ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.

          -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.

          into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and

</b>                    Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
                    yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
                    the questions. What we think we know --
                    is that there's some kind of
                    electrochemical communication between the
                    roots of the trees. Like the synapses
                    between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it, and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on Pandora --

</b><b>                               GRACE
</b>                    That's more connections than the human
                    brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
                    global network. And the Na'vi can access
                    it -- they can upload and download data --
                    memories -- at sites like the one you
                    destroyed.

                    of this world isn't in the ground -- it's

<b>          
</b>          NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an
          assault rifle.
<b>          
</b>          THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters

</b>          RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their

<b>          
</b>          TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
          like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
          FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
          is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
<b>          
</b>          NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the

<b>          
</b>          STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi

<b>          
</b>          AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are

          the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE

<b>          
</b>          The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
          his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
          CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
          There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
<b>          
</b>          SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
          riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
          cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.

          Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --

          SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
<b>          
</b>          A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
          air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
<b>          
</b>          WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
          dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
          and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
          smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
<b>          
</b>          IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
          tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
          stub-wing pods.

</b>          NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her.   A Scorpion is
          right on her ass as --

</b>          SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
          Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling

</b>          SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
<b>          
</b>          HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
          launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
          The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
          shock wave.
<b>          
</b>          THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons

          rolled up on their sides and --

</b>          THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --

</b>          A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
<b>          
</b>          K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
          downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control.
<b>          
</b>          Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
<b>          
</b>          FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
          This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
          breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
<b>          
</b>          TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
          with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
<b>          
</b>          The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.

                    pricks.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
          her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
          trees, under the canopy.
<b>          
</b>          They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
          half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
          Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
<b>          
</b>          THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
          follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
          of blue-skinned figures.
<b>          
</b>          THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --

</b><b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a

</b>          TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
          in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --

</b>          A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
<b>          
</b>          TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
          and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.

</b>          GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
<b>          
</b>          TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His

</b>          A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
          at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
<b>          
</b>          NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s

          pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.

</b>          NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
          she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.

</b>          TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
<b>          
</b>          QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
          the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
          laugh -- he dies.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
          Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.

<b>                          SELVIG
</b>           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

<b>                          NICK FURY

          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

<b>                          NICK FURY

</b>           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           At this end?

<b>                          CLINT BARTON
</b>           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Please don't. I still need that.

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>
<b>                          (TURNING)
</b>           This doesn't have to get any messier.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

<b>                          SELVIG

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Free from what?

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

<b>                          LOKI

           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

<b>                          CLINT BARTON
</b>           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

</b>           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

</b>           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

<b>                          NICK FURY

          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

<b>          BACK AT THE LAB

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

<b>          BACK AT THE LAB

</b>           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the

<b>          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT
</b>
          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

<b>          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT
</b>
          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

<b>          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

<b>          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT
</b>
          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

<b>          EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT
</b>
          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

<b>          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

<b>          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT
</b>
          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

<b>          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT
</b>
          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

<b>          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
</b>          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

<b>          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.
</b>
<b>          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT
</b>
          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

<b>          JULES WINNFIELD.
</b>          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

</b>           A lot of men still under, don't know

</b>
          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

<b>                          (IN ENGLISH)
</b>           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

<b>                          WEASELLY THUG
</b>           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           Who the hell is...

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.

           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Are you kidding? I'm working!

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           This takes precedence.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

<b>                          LUCHKOV
</b>           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

<b>          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
</b>          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

<b>          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
</b>          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Where's Barton now?

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           But he's alive.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

</b>           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           Why?

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

<b>                          BANNER

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           I'll persuade you.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           And what if the... other guy says no?

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           I don't always get what I want.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

<b>                          BANNER

           it?

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           So Fury isn't after the monster?

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Not that he's told me.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           And he tells you everything?

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           He needs me in a cage?

          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the

           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

<b>                          NATASHA

<b>           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
</b>           This is out of line, Director. You're

<b>           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

</b>           Not Asgard. Loki.

</b>           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We

           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory

          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

<b>                          STEVE

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

<b>                          STEVE

</b>           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           At this point, I doubt anything would

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           Not gonna be that subtle.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           On the lease.

<b>                          TONY

<b>                          JARVIS
</b>           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           You have reached the life model decoy

          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

</b>           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           I didn't know that either.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           That I did know.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

</b>           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           I was having twelve percent of a

           pretty shaken.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

<b>                          PEPPER

<b>                          TONY
</b>           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           This.

<b>          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

<b>                          PEPPER
</b>           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

<b>          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY
</b>
          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

<b>                          PILOT
</b>           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           Didn't really go his way, did it?

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

<b>          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY
</b>
          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,

</b>
          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

<b>                          THE OTHER
</b>           The Chitauri grow restless.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Let them go at themselves. I will lead

<b>                          THE OTHER
</b>           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is

<b>                          THE OTHER
</b>           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           I was a king! The rightful king of

<b>                          THE OTHER
</b>           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

<b>                          LOKI
</b>           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

<b>                          THE OTHER
</b>           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

<b>          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP ­ DAY
</b>
          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON

<b>           AGENT PHIL COULSON
</b>           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

<b>                          STEVE

<b>                          NATASHA
</b>           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

<b>                          STEVE

           Must be strange for you, all of this.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           Well, this is actually kind of

          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

<b>                          STEVE

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP ­ a flurry of
          activity ­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

<b>           AGENT MARIA HILL

<b>          EXT. SKY
</b>
          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the

          camouflages in the sky.

<b>          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ CONTINUOUS

<b>                          NICK FURY
</b>           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

<b>                          NICK FURY

          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's

          his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the

          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!

          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

<b>                          TONY

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

<b>          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

<b>                          BANNER

<b>                          BANNER

           strut.

           Well, I think that was meant for you.

          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in

          possible.

<b>                          STEVE
</b>           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

<b>                          TONY

           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

           This stops it. This little circle of

<b>                          TONY
</b>           Because I learned how.

<b>                          BANNER
</b>           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

<b>          OUTLETS.
</b>          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto

           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single

</b>           That was the plan.

<b>                          TONY
</b>           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

<b>                          LOKI

</b>           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be

          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits

          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the

<b>          EXT. SKY ­ DAY
</b>
          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

<b>          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY
</b>
          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

<b>          EXT. SPACE
</b>
          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

<b>          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY
</b>
          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
          through.

<b>          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY
</b>
          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
          waiting.

<b>                          BLACK WIDOW
</b>           Come on, Stark...

<b>          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY
</b>
          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
          Cap.

<b>                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
</b>           (to BLACK WIDOW)
           Close it.

<b>          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY
</b>
          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

          Thor swings Mjölnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

<b>          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A
</b>
<b>          BUILDING.
</b>
<b>          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

<b>          EXT. CENTRAL PARK ­ DAY
</b>
          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

<b>    FADE IN:
</b><b>1   TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE
</b>
    PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
    various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
    wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
    in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
    grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
    name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
    Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
    being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
    martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
    few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
    clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
    Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
    FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

<b>                                              DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</b>    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
    CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
    SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
    whips in the fierce downdraft as --
<b>3   "HUEY" GUNSHIP
</b>    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
    lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
    wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
    machine gun positions around the LZ.
<b>4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
</b>    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
    and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
    jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."

<b>5   HELICOPTER
</b>    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
    their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
    -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
    ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.

<b>6   LEADER OF THREE
</b>
    wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.
<b>7   NICO AND FOX
</b>
    don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             2.

</b>                  You ever see chemical interrogation
                  before?

     Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON,
     for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
<b>                                NICO
</b>                  These assholes are agency?

<b>9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO
</b><b>                                FOX
</b>                  We're all C.I.A. But these guys are
                  from a page that ain't on the map.
<b>10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>     Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
     Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
     We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader
     and totally at home   in the jungle.
<b>11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>     snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
     let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
<b>                                ZAGON
</b>                  How long till we're across the border?

</b>                  We've been over for the past hour.
     The group continues along the ridge.

<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
     The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
<b>13   NICO
</b>
     listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
     at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
<b>                                ZAGON
</b>                  What are you looking at, hotshot?

</b><b>                                                         3.

     Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               Just drive the taxi, ace.

     As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
     "Don't fuck with these guys."

<b>14   EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
     A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
     several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
     through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
     100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
<b>                             FOX
</b>                      (to Zagon)
               They're in there.

     The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
     glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
<b>                             NICO
</b>               I don't trust these yo-yo's.
<b>15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
</b>     We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
     to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
     ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.

<b>16   DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
</b>     hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
<b>17   NICO'S POV - HOOCH
</b>     Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
     coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
     guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
     heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
     gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.

<b>18   BACK TO NICO
</b>     He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
     hooch.

<b>19   INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
</b>     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
     and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
     squirt-tests it.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          4.
</b>
<b>20   TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
</b>     are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
     tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
     hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
     first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
     prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
     Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.

<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                 That's the nice thing about modern
                 technology. You don't have to wait
                 for results.

     He moves close to the first prisoner.
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                        (to first prisoner)
                 Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
                 of our shit --
     The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
     that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
<b>21   EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO
</b>
     hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the
     hooch --
<b>22   INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER
</b>
     has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
     referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
     Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                 Don't you die on me, fucker --
<b>                               FOX
</b>                        (from the side)
                 What the hell's wrong?
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                        (throws the prisoner
                         down)
                 This pussy can't hold his liquor.

     The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.

<b>23   NICO
</b>     enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
     to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,

     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
     it to the others, too.

<b>24   FIRST PRISONER
</b>     dies in agony on the ground.

<b>25   SECOND PRISONER
</b>     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
     scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
     higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
     since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
     customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
     daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
     prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
     back down an inch.
<b>                             ZAGON

     Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
     fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
     a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
     blade in the lantern light.

<b>26   NICO

               What did you do with my shit? --
<b>27   ZAGON
</b>     punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
     handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
     terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
     crashes  sideways, face bloody --

     Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
     over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.

The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
Zagon's with defiance --

<b>                       ZAGON
</b>                (to prisoner)
         You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
         You took it from the Chinks... you took
         it from the French. You'll be fucked
         if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
         your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner.

</b>         -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,

Nico takes a step toward Zagon.

         Back off, partner --
Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
<b>                       ZAGON
</b>                (to second prisoner)
         I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
         We'll throw your feet in that box right
         over there. Then I'm gonna take off
         your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon.

     Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
     Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
     terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
     Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
     ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
     comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
     in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
     move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
     his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
     out of the hooch --
<b>30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT

     Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

               What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
     Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
     away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
     .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
     hooch --

     The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
     Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --

     The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
     pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
     seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
     apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
     troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

     Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
     trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
     Nico disappears into the darkness.

     they're late --

     A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
     last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        *
     -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
     final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
     straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
     around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
     relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
     uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
     with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
     garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
     all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm

     His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
     class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
     subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
     photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.

Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          *
sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         *
ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     *
almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening
into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.

      The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
      Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his

     Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the
     detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con-
     tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands
     with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as
     a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being
     flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico
     heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench
     next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker.
     It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street-

     Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then
     sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson
     comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted.

     Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi.
<b>92   REAR DINING ROOM
</b>     From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux,
     looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and
     Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few
     words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket,
     hands it to Salvano.

     As the Barmaid brings their drinks. Jackson sees her
     peaceful week to retirement flying out the window.

     Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and
     does a playful twirl.

      The two men, dressed as meat processors in hard hats and
      bloody white coats, rake cattle guts under the eave of a

      Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot
      with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers"
      keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a
      seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.

<b>136A   OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM

       on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there

       Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite

</b>
      Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a
      day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front
      of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their
      tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and
      look around.

      Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy
      sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard
      alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.

</b>               Father Genarro.
      The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.

      The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps
      glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly
      driving by.
<b>153   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

      This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an
      underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored
      along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.
      Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico
      and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.
      They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a
      break-in has taken place.

      Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks
      again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like
      he's from Central America stands in the doorway.

<b>                              FATHER GENARRO

      The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --

      A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.
      Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,
      various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly
      -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.
      Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER
      TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.

      Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment
      between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what
      he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father

      The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico
      reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING.
      Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church.
      He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front
      of the church and turn, heading down one of the side
      aisles.

      wave of   the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere --

      Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out
      the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls
      in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-
      rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward
      his car --

      Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously. As he reaches to
      his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open. A
      .38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head. Instantly three
      other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk.

      Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its
      shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the
      alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of
      them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.

           starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his
           wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,
           keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun
           Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,
           slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing
           the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his
           wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain
           link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man
           (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-
           ing, half-unconscious.
      C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's
           head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of
           the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,
           blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing
           Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes
           down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in
           pain.
      D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,
           flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-
           ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the
           van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with
           just his head and shoulders dangling free.

      E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar
           Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,
           and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-
           tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one
           knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,
           machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and
           whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of
           Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-
           mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at
           his own groin.
      F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-
           perately to regain his senses. He tries to get
           Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-
           way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,
           bolts.

      G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to
           Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van
           window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the
           head, then tears off after Machete Man --

<b>192   EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>      Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,
      straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he
      vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He
      too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --

      An all-out foot face.

</b>
      Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.
      TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.

<b>                             FIRST GIRL

      tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's
      gaining --
<b>195   INT. BODEGA - DAY
</b>
      Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a
      Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the
      hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes
      Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --

<b>196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY
</b>      Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with
      tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,
      which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone
      inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --
<b>197   BACK TO NICCO
</b>      pursuing along the same route.
<b>198   MACHETE MAN
</b>
      claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-
      work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-
      bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked
      between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,
      starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.
      Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto
      the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as
      the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.
      Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-
      jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by
      the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-
      fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --

<b>199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY
</b>      Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with
      terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man
      scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner
      next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move
      either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The
      girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.

<b>                              MACHETE MAN

Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard
from the chase.

<b>                           NICO

<b>                            MACHETE MAN

Nico grabs him by the hair.
<b>                           NICO
</b>             You didn't come after me for a

                     neck)

<b>                             MACHETE MAN
</b>             I told ya!    No one!
Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood
doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even
louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
<b>                           NICO
</b>                    (shouting)
             Shut up!
The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back
to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking
the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see
that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
<b>                          NICO
</b>                   Give it to me!
Nico raises his fist to strike.

<b>                           MACHETE MAN
</b>             Jimmy Constanza!
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's
wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-
part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He
grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete
Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.

<b>                           NICO
</b>             If you're lying to me, I'll come
             and kill you right in your own
             fucking kitchen.

Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly
Machete Man changes his tune.

      Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
      He hits the ground with a thud.

<b>                               NICO
</b>                 Gracias, muchacho.
      Nico walks away.

</b>           Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add-
           ress books, 3X5 cards. He's on the phone, impatient,
           apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone down.
<b>      B)   INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
           Nico paces, phone cradled to ear, talking urgently.
           CLICK: he's been hung up on; he looks at the receiver
           in frustration and disgust.
<b>      C)   CLOSE - CORKBOARD ON KITCHEN WALL

</b>           Nico holds Julian, goes over notes.

<b>      G)   CLOSE - YELLOW LEGAL PAD
</b>           The page is headed: "FATHER GENARRO." Below in

           thing on Salvano?" "Church break-in?" "Drug infor-

           Nico's pencil crosses everything out.

      Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING
      of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico
      glance at each other --

                It's bad, Nico.

      Nico glances to Sara. The voice on the   phone is not
      Jackson. Nico is chilled. He glances    to Sara, finger to
      his lips. He points to his bare wrist   as if wanting to know
      the exact time. Sara, not sure what's   going on, mouths:

      the FBI agents who authorized the release of Salvano. He

      others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
      to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
      gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a

      wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         *
      ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes
      his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men
      sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his
      eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again
      to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles
      toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men
      has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a
      second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering
      into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet.
      One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the
      freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The
      GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's
      three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into
      his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails
      into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land
      a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered
      forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

      The Woman walks slowly down the hall. She carries a small
      donation can. She knocks on a door. We hear FOOTSTEPS from
      within the apartment. The door opens. It's Bonifacia, the
      nun from the church (though now in civvies). The Middle-Aged
      Woman with the donation can raises it as if asking for a
      contribution. Bonificia looks flustered, impatient. She
      really doesn't want to leave the door open.

      He is in a chair, his wrists strapped to the chair arms.    He

      Behind Father Tomassino, we see Salvano, Chi Chi and two
      other goons, armed with pistols. Salvano moves toward the
      priest, sets a small TV table down beside him. The priest
      glances toward it --

      aging since SE Asia. His face is even scarier than when he
      performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon prepares
      a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward.

       Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her
       leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson
       accepts this reluctantly.

</b>      Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent
      building; he and Lukich start for it.

<b>298   INT. APARTMENT
</b>      Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of
      Zagon's chemicals. In spite of this the priest's spirit to
      resist is astounding...

</b>      Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The
      roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair
      creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the
      roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover
      to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that
      leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of
      the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door
      open --

      The drugs have taken hold. The priest's brain is an open

      Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down. Nico crosses
      silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of
      the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door.
      Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up
      positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC
      CONTINUES from inside.
<b>304   INSIDE APARTMENT

      Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening
      to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.

      The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat
      beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies
      of some narcotic hell.

      Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in,
      guns clutched two-handed.
<b>306   QUICK CUTS
</b>
      The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him.
      Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed-
      off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to
      dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE-
      BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan-
      taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the
      priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the
      shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs
      Lukich, dives out the door with him --

      Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away
      toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the
      apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at
      Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam
      into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs!
      Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches
      Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll,
      down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony,     *
      twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls
      the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through
      the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench-
      man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi
      Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the
      ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!

      Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new

      footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof
      from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate,
      taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico

       makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown-

      Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and             *
      Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who
      has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack?
      Run for it?

Fox pulls his .45 from concealment, covering Nico. An
EVENING-GOWNED WOMAN, waiting with her husband for their
car, hears Fox's shout, sees his gun.

      their alarm; he swings his jacket open, revealing a snub

      He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls
      his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down,
      a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his
      feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who
      snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN
      FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a
      concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by
      GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A
      second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops
      from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind
      the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and
      valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in

      Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the

      hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man --

      stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped

      weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull.
<b>406   ZAGON
</b>
      finishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink. He
      is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed.
      When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing
      to operate.

<b>                             ZAGON

               You've got to learn to take time,

      Zagon turns to Nico.
<b>                             NICO
</b>               How are you gonna do him, Zagon?
               In a motorcade? Or passing
               through a hotel kitchen?
      The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and
      choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a
      small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch.
      Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter-
      rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes,
      scalpels, surgical tools.

<b>                             ZAGON

               -- This'll be the first time I've

      glove.

      seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon
      tight to Nico's head.

      Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair
      reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --

<b>                              ZAGON
</b>               Hold him up!
      Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him
      again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains
      from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands
      Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs
      off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico
      back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico
      looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the
      opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his
      beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes
      with defiance.

<b>                             ZAGON

               check out.
      He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent
      and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon
      injects Nico.

<b>407   NICO
</b>      reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under
      the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him-
      self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               That's it. Fight it, cherry.
               Fight it, so it speeds faster on
               its way --
      Nico struggles more violently.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               Fight it. Till the vessels burst
               in your brain. Till the arteries
               rupture in your heart --

      Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go
      limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               That's my boy. That's what I was
               waiting for --
      Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent
      and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens
      his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer,
      gloating, cooing --
<b>
</b><b>                                                          107.

                        in hand)
                You should have killed me when
                you had the chance, Toscani --

      The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs
      to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the
      cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped
      hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him
      ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor,
      half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-
      gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's
      face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing
      the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by
      inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.
      The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder
      holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping
      him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,
      spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun
      barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!
      Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with
      a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a
      double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun
      to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp
      scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He
      yanks the choke cable off his neck --

<b>408   ZAGON - AGAINST WALL
</b>      On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,
      snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face
      battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.
<b>                              ZAGON
</b>                Can you feel the chemicals,

<b>                              NICO
</b>                Long enough to finish you.
      Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an
      animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon
      in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose
      and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's
      elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in
      a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against
      the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is
      screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs
      have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes
      are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of
      strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle
      free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-
      ing sound.

       As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up
       around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with
       one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did
       to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body
       crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers
       toward the door --

<b>414   NICO
</b>      passes out in Jackson's arms. Behind them we see a banner,
      announcing Senator Harrison's address. From the ballroom we
      hear CHEERS and APPLAUSE. A fiery address is being finished
      inside. The senator is now leaving.
<b>415   FULL SHOT - LOBBY
</b>
      Total confusion. Guests staring everywhere. From a side
      office, a man with a medical bag comes running. The senator
      sees the group around Nico.

      He holds out his hand.    Nico takes it.   The senator gestures
      to Judge Alspauch.

	on the side of the plane.

</b>
<b>	ANGLE DOWN
</b>
	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

<b>				EMIL (V.O.)
</b>		Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
		say.  Don't open your mouth.

<b>				OLEG (V.O.)
</b>		Okay.

<b>	INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
	split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
	visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
	unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
	Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His
	eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

	OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
	tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
	(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Don't fool around.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Okay.

	Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
	take a picture of himself.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Did you hear what I said?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I want to document my trip to America.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Next.
			(Emil steps up)
		Could I see your documents, please?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yes sir.

	He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
	image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		What is your intended purpose of your
		visit to the United States?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Two weeks holiday.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		How much money are you carrying with
		you?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I have five-hundred dollars.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
		FIS area!

	Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
	Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>			(to Emil)
		Is he with you?  Are you travelling
		together?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yes.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Please join us.
			(to Oleg)
		Come on forward.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Is there a problem?

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		No, you're travelling together.  I want
		to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
		you?  Can I take a look at your
		documents?
			(takes Oleg's passport)
		Are you related?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Yes...he's my friend.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Okay.  You're a Czech national and
		you're a Russian national.  How do you
		know one another?

	Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		We are both from Prague.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>			(to Oleg)
		How long are you planning to stay?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Two weeks.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		He doesn't speak English.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I speak English.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>			(to Oleg)
		Then answer my questions.  Where were
		you planning to stay during the two
		weeks that you're here?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		New York.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Yes, we're in New York now.  But where
		are you planning to stay in New York?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		A cheap hotel.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		What are you coming here to do?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I'm here for movies.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Movies...to be in the movies or to see
		movies?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
		see movie at school called "It's a
		Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. 
		Ever since I want to come to America. 
		Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
		land where anyone can be anything. As
		long as they are white.

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Excuse me?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
		airplane...

	The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

<b>				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
</b>		Well, they've got valid visas, but they
		don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm
		not...uh, I think there's a possibility
		they may be coming to live and reside.

<b>				SUPERVISOR
</b>		Look how long the line is.  We gotta
		move 'em out.  I'll take them down to
		secondary.

	Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

<b>	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
	The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
	bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
	his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
	Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
	is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
	he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
	the subject of several magazine articles.  There's even been
	a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
	with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

	Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
	reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story."  Hawkins is also
	the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
	Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

	Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
	Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
	story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
		we got Emergency Service with the heavy
		weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I
		say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
		go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
		sudden I turn around and a kid with a
		shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
		standin'.  That coulda been it.  I
		coulda had my head blown off and for
		what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
		takes the safety off and it's over.  If
		I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
		a bad habit - I would've had my head
		blown off.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Jesus Christ.

	PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

<b>				PAULIE
</b>		Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Another martini.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Vodka tonic.

<b>				LEON
</b>			(rethinks it)
		Maybe you could just put in a shot of
		Martell?

	Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
	vodka.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>			(of Eddie's story)
		It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid
		kid.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What's the kid gonna say - sorry? 
		Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. 
		Like last week - we were at the morgue
		and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
		here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
		Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
		dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who
		knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3
		or some shit and shot him and now you
		can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
		human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. 
		Sooner or later.  That's me.  

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Sooner or later that's everybody.  

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
		that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
		Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
		Plaque here and there and in a coupla
		years no one remembers me anymore.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I think you're getting a little moody
		there, Eddie.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I'm not moody.

	Hawkins and Leon share a look.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Isn't he a little moody?

<b>				LEON
</b>		Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in
		love.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		In love?  With who?

	Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
	Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		How old are your kids?

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. 
		Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're
		thinking about having a kid!  How old
		are you?  Never mind. 
		Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
		cliche you hear about kids - they change
		your life, they make you a better
		person, they make you whole...
			(beat)
		It's all true!  Before I had kids when
		friends talked about their kids, I
		wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
		right, Leon?

<b>				LEON
</b>		Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have
		all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
		so much as looks sideways at my four
		girls -- I'd kill 'em.  
			(takes out his wallet)
		You haven't seen my youngest have you?

	As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Paulie, you've got kids, right?

<b>				PAULIE
</b>		My kids don't talk to me anymore but
		they were great when they were young.

<b>				LEON
</b>			(into the phone)
		Sure it's him?  Great!
			(collapses the phone)
		Unique's home.

	They all rise from the table.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Paulie, I need the cure.

<b>				PAULIE
</b>		Step into my office.

	Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
		You still singing in the church on the
		weekends?

<b>	INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've
	been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

<b>				SECONDARY OFFICER
</b>		Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
		understand that.
			(to Emil)
		And what kind of work do you do?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I am butcher.

<b>				SECONDARY OFFICER
</b>		You're a butcher?  What do you use pig
		intestines for?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		You stuff sausage in it.

<b>				SECONDARY OFFICER
</b>		And what do you do with the bones?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Dog food.

	Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
	Control for their detainment.

<b>				SECONDARY OFFICER
</b>		Are you married?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		No.  Are you proposing?

<b>	ANGLE UP
</b>
	through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

<b>	INT. MENS ROOM
</b>
	Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
	full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
	eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
		What are you doin' Saturday?

	Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		I'm gonna propose.

<b>				LEON
</b>		When?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Tomorrow.  At lunch.

<b>				LEON
</b>		You ready?

	Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

<b>	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
</b>
	Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
	action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

<b>				OLEG
</b>			(in Russian)
		Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
		movies!

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(in Czech)
		Don't speak Russian!

<b>				OLEG
</b>			(in Russian)
		Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
		you in Czech?

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(in Czech)
		Because I don't like your ugly language. 
		I heard enough of it in school!  Now
		speak Czech or English.  And don't fool
		around anymore.  You almost got us
		thrown out!

	Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This
	is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
	inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
	videocamera's pointed out in the street.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Look.  New videocameras.  Color
		viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
		Solarization.  Night vision.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		We have no money.  Come on.

	Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
	Emil slides into the cab.

<b>				CABBIE
</b>		Where you wanna go, buddy?

	Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
	return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
	Cabbie.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Here.

	Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
	hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
	coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
	and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
	out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Go!

	Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
<b>		
</b>
<b>	EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY
</b>
	Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		So what's unique?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Not what.  Who.

	Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
	covered in blood.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
		taking too long to put her make-up on. 
		they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
		with a beer bottle.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		That's unique.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

	Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

<b>				LOOKOUT
</b>		Top floor.  Back room.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
		news and I look good.  But the problem
		with becoming a star is downtown.  They
		shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

	As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
	Waves them off.  They hurry away.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees
		are killing me.  Stay behind me.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		You're worried for my safety.  I'm
		touched.

	Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
	the fire escape.

<b>				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
</b>		Ready?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Keep them out of my way.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Okay.  You ready?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

	Eddie closes in.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>			(into his cell phone)
<b>		COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
</b><b>		LET'S MOVE IT!
</b>
	Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
	the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
	the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
	he lands dropping his gun.

	Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What's your rush?  Going to a party?

<b>				UNIQUE
</b>		Why you chasin' me, man?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I don't know.  You always come outta
		your house that way?

<b>				UNIQUE
</b>		It's not my house, man.  I don't live
		here.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Well, sounds like burglary to me.

	Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

<b>				UNIQUE
</b>		I know you man.

	An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
	mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>			(to Eddie)
		Any chance we can do that again?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first
		time.
<b>						
</b>
<b>	EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY
</b>
	The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
	gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
	into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
	back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Turn that off!  Get the bags.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
		dog.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		For five years I paid for your
		stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
		rest of my life if I say so.
			(challenging)
		Unless you refuse, Oleg.

	Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
	he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
	occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		There.  5RW.

	Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
	and Emil pushes it open.

<b>	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY
</b>
	The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
	stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
	pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		What?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Smell like chemicals...for smoking
		drugs.

	Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
	down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

<b>	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
	a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
	He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
	films him...

<b>				MILOS
</b>		Emil???!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Surprise!  Surprise!

	Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
	comely wife.

<b>	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
	plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
	has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
	apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
	bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
	kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
	a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
	following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Your sister said she didn't know where
		you were so you shouldn't write to her
		with return address if you're hiding. 

<b>				MILOS
</b>		Did you hurt her?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
		Where's the money?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Hello, Tamina.

	Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
	at Oleg.

<b>				MILOS
</b>		Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
			(to Emil)
		Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were
		caught.
			(of Oleg)
		It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank
		clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going
		to wait!!!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Milos.  Get my money!

	Oleg videotapes the scene.

<b>	CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR
</b>
	All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
	obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
	around her.

<b>				MILOS
</b>			(nervously)
		We spent it!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Ha. Ha.

<b>				MILOS
</b>		Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. 
		You think I'd be working if I had
		money?!

	Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
	KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
	throat.

<b>				MILOS (CONT'D)
</b>		Emil.  Put down the knife.

	Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

<b>				MILOS (CONT'D)
</b>		Emil.  I'll help you.

	Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
	him by talking softly.

<b>				MILOS (CONT'D)
</b>		I can get you a job.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		A job?

<b>				MILOS
</b>		Yes, the money is good.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		As a plumber?!

<b>				MILOS
</b>		It's easy to learn.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
		come to America to work!

<b>				MILOS
</b>		We started over, you can too.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(furious)
		You spent all the money while I was in
		prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
		fixing toilets?!?

	Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
	it toward Milos' chest!

	Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
	Emil killed Milos.

	Blood sprays Tamina's face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
	her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
	floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
	Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

<b>	THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR
</b>
	flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
	Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
	the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
	the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
	wet.  

	She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
	down the alley.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		She saw!

	Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
	shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
	Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
	opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Daphne Hanlova.

	There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
	arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
	STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
	blank pages.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Six month visa.  Still here two years
		later.  They'll deport her if she goes
		to Police.

	Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
	shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
	floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
	and bottles aside.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		What are you looking for?

	Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

	Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
	darkness.
<b>		
</b><b>		EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
</b>
	A face comes from the darkness.  It's an athletically
	handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He's in a
	tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
	He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
	honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
	in his path.

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare
		twenty?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Look, I don't have time for you, get out
		of my way!!

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
		money?

	The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
	grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
	manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
	behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
	BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
	the mugger's head.  Jordy displays his shield.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you
		happy?

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry
		guns.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Oh yeah?  Guess again.

	Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
	pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
	credit cards.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Nice - how many people you ripped off
		tonight?!  Get up!

	As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		You couldn't listen to me, could you?

	Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
	pressed up against the bark.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		I'll send a cop back for you.

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like
		this.  Some freak'll come by and stab
		me!

	Jordy jogs off across the park.

<b>				MUGGER (CONT'D)
</b>		Wait!  Come back!!

<b>	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There's
	a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
	floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
	reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
	and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		Lieutenant - take up your line and
		relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
		floor.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Hey, Louie, were you first due?

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
		'cause you got two roasts on the top
		floor but you don't hafta investigate
		cause homicide is up there.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't
		make it a crime scene yet.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

<b>				KORFIN (O.S.)
</b>		Yo, Jordy!

	BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
	with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
	turnout coat.

<b>				KORFIN (CONT'D)
</b>		Where you been, man?  We got a
		celebrity!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I heard.  Who the hell let them up
		there?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		I don't know, you think Eddie will give
		me his autograph?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
		suspicious?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Oh yeah, why?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
		now!

<b>	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,
	smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
	what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
	charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
	listening to Leon.

<b>				LEON
</b>		So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
		position - that they were doin' each
		other but were so whacked out of their
		heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
		lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
		you think, Eddie?

	Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I don't know.  We got the experts here. 
		Show them what you found - I hope you
		don't mind, we came over to see if we
		could help.

	Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
	celebrity.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
		Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
		you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
		the job is picking up scents.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Oh, sure.

	Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
	holder and pockets it to finish later.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Well, I found - check it out - crack
		pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

	Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
	shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Sorry, bro.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Hey, that's great you guys got it all
		wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
		through the routine?  It gives us
		somethin' to do.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

<b>				LEON
</b>		No.  Go ahead.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Thanks.  Appreciate it.

	Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
	respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie
	rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
	living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
		good patterns - about thirty minutes
		old.

	Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
	rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
	glove comes out white.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Mouth's clean, too.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Clean?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Don't blow your nose!

	Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
		burn 'em out.  Let it run.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		But you knew that, right?

	Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
	turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
	room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		So the way you see it, two crack heads
		burned themselves up?

<b>				LEON
</b>		That's what it looks like to me.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		And while they're burning up, they're
		still goin' down on each other?  You got
		to hand it to them.

<b>				LEON
</b>			(realizes he's wrong - blows it
			 off)
		Yeah, well, some people got their
		priorities straight.

	Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
	pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
	heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
	inside.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		What was that?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Evidence.  Of a homicide.

	That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		You know what that is, right?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		No, what is it?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
			(to a fireman joking a wall)
		Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
		in the floor?

<b>				CAMELLO
</b>		No problem.
			(to Eddie and Leon)
		Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
		back up a little more.  Don't wanna get
		your pants wet.

	Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
	set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and Korfin explains:

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		They have not soot in their mouths,
		which means they weren't breathin'
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased - and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something, probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed.  To the
		untrained eye, it looks like an
		accident.

	Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
	something.

<b>				LEON
</b>		What's he looking for?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		A timer.

	Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
	on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
	Jordy and moves to Eddie.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Here you go.  A big double homicide.

<b>	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
	arriving.  Jumps out. 
	Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the
	trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
		timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		He knew all along.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		What??

<b>				JORDY
</b>		That's why he was so quiet.  He was
		testing us.

	Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
	inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
	microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected
	by her peers.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Detective, does it look like a murder?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		We don't know that yet.  It's much too
		early.  There's a lot to be done.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		How many victims are up there?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		There are two bodies found at this
		point.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Can we go up to the crime scene?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Is it drug related?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		We don't know.  When I have more I'll
		let you know.

	Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
	Eddie's hand.  She barrels on...

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Detective...what's that you're holding
		in your hand?  Evidence?

	Mike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive,
	hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
	as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
	the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
	HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
	She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
	glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
	crowd - but Daphne is gone.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		What?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		There was a woman - I think she wanted
		to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
		shit!  Oh no!

<b>	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
</b>
	Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
	Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
	now NAKED!

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped
		me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
		all over, it was disgusting.

	Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

	Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		You okay?

<b>				MUGGER
</b>		A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you
		for this!  You violated my civil rights!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
		me!  I could arrest you right now! 
		You're lucky you're walking away from
		this.  Now get outta here.

	Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
	himself cursing - hurrying away.

</b>
<b>	EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
	Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
	sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

<b>	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
	the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
	trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
	twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
	angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
	He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
	behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
	been talking to a FATHER.

<b>				ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
</b>		So you slept with your son's wife! 
		What's that all about?

<b>				FATHER (ON T.V.)
</b>		I take full responsibility for sleepin'
		with my daughter in law.  I had low self
		esteem, I thought I had to compete with
		him.

	Emil reaches for his dictionary.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(mutters)
		Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

	He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
	esteem.

<b>				FATHER (ON T.V.)
</b>		Losin' my job and everything, caused my
		behavioral disorder.
			(turns to his son)
		Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

	The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

	Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
	in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
	rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time -
	as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
	between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's
	wearing Milos' Rolex. 
	Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
	earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil
	looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(Czech)
		Turn that fucking thing off!

<b>				OLEG
</b>			(Czech)
		I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos
		die.  It's just like a move but realer.

	Emil grabs the videocamera.
			(Czech)
		Don't break it!  Don't break it!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Speak English!

<b>				OLEG
</b>			(English)
		You said speak Czech!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		How you erase this?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

	Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
	bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
	camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
	Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill
		him.
			(noticing)
		What's this?

	Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a
	picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
	ESCORTS - and a number.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Worldly escorts?

	Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
	finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
	number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
	background.

<b>				SEXY VOICE
</b>		Hi?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Hello?

<b>				SEXY VOICE
</b>		Are you looking for companionship?

	Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Whore?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European
		girl?  A Czech girl?

<b>				SEXY VOICE
</b>		Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
		girl.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I take her.  Send her!

<b>	EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT
</b>
	Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
	returning.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Now that you know him, maybe you can get
		extra work in the next movie they make
		about him.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Maybe you can be his stand-in.

<b>	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT
</b>
	The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
	the high of fighting a fire.  Korfin and Jordy walk toward
	the TV room.  The TV is on in the background.  We can see
	Nicolette interviewing Eddie.  He holds up the paint can.

<b>				CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
</b>		What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie
		Flemming the evidence?!

	They turn.  DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
	of the arson squad - comes over.  Duffy's tough, Irish and
	very political.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>			(pointing to the TV)
		Who did cause and origin?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Who do you think, Chief?!

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Then why didn't you talk to the
		reporter?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		'Cause we got more important things to
		do, like finding out who did it.

	They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Don't you guys understand?  It's all
		about image.  The better we look the
		more money I get to pay you guys
		overtime.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Yeah, right.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		What was that, Korfin?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As
		soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
		alert the media.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve
		this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

	They all head upstairs.

<b>	INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.  There are posters of
	pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.  GARCIA - a
	Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just
		gave a full confession.

	A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
	turns.  He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
	scratched cross etched in his forehead.  He craves attention.

<b>				MAX
</b>		It's my fire!  Screw homicide.  I'll
		tell you guys everything!

	Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.  They sit across from
	each other.  Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
	bothering to stop.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		What's that on your forehead, Max? 
		That's a nice attention getter.

<b>				MAX
</b>		Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist
		like you!  Now, are you guys gonna
		arrest me, or not?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		How did you start the fire this time?

<b>				MAX
</b>		I used an accelerant.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Yeah?  What kind?

<b>				MAX
</b>			(to Jordy)
		Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
		your wife leavin' you.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Max.

<b>				MAX
</b>			(continuing)
		...Yeah, and with your old man dying
		last year you - what's it?  Just you and
		the dog now?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Max!  

<b>				MAX
</b>		Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
		your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
		big shot downtown.

	Jordy pops out of his seat.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		That's it!  You're outta here.

	Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.

<b>				MAX
</b>		That's it.  I'm suing.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Get in line.

	Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia
	who is laughing.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		What's so funny.  How does he know so
		much about me?  Who tells him my life
		story?

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		He hangs around downstairs.  The guys
		talk to him.  He's a joke...

<b>				JORDY
</b>		He's no joke!  One day he's gonna
		graduate from trash can fires and do
		something big.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the
		station.

<b>	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT

	As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
	accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
	America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
		this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you
		an exclusive interview with Stephen
		Geller - who horrified the nation two
		years ago when he went berserk and
		murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
		shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's
		claim, spoken softly and articulately,
		is that he is the victim.  According to
		Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
		day were not his fault but were the
		fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to
		believe...watch.

<b>				EMIL (O.S.)
</b>		Louder.

	VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
	on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Louder.

	Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
	volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
	interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's
	sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
	stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
	background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird
	dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the
	paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		This had nothing to do with shoes that
		didn't fit or my relationship with my
		father who, as you know, made a fortune
		selling penny loafers in the fifties. 
		These people died because of the
		criminal actions of my doctor.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		Your doctor?

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that
		I stay on my medication.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		...so you feel absolutely no
		responsibility for killing these people?

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		It was my finger that pulled the
		trigger, but I'm not morally
		responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what
		I was capable of.  How could I know. 
		I'm not a doctor.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		You seem very savvy for a man who's been
		found mentally incompetent to stand
		trial.

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a
		year away from getting my masters in
		Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life
		has been permanently disrupted.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you
		selling paintings now for quite a lot of
		money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you
		call it, jump started your career as an
		artist?

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		Look, I'm in here.  You call this a
		career move?

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		And isn't there a movie in the works
		about you?

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		We're in negotiations, that's correct.

<b>				ROBERT HAWKINS
</b>		But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
		criminals from profiting from their
		crimes?

<b>				STEPHEN GELLER
</b>		That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
		a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I
		wasn't convicted.

	Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I love America.  No one is responsible
		for what they do.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
	to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Get in the bathroom!

<b>				OLEG (O.S.)
</b>		Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
		shut up!

	Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom,
	closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks
	down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
	sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants
	cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
	and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class.

<b>				HONEY
</b>		Hi, I'm Honey.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Where's Czech girl?

<b>				HONEY
</b>		Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. 
		I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm
		a Czech girl.

	She enters.  Closes the door behind her.

<b>				HONEY (CONT'D)
</b>		Now I like to get business out of the
		way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
		don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you
		know her?

	Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.  During the rest of
	the scene Oleg films her.  Honey begins to undress.

<b>				HONEY
</b>		It's an outcall service run out of an
		apartment.  I don't meet the other
		girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Where is escort service?

<b>				HONEY
</b>		That's confidential.  Could you put the
		money on the dresser?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I like to talk to the person who runs
		the service.  Can you give me address?

<b>				HONEY
</b>		Look.  Do we have a problem here? 
		There's no reason to have a problem. 
		I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You
		wanna Czech girl? 
		After I'm done with you, you won't miss
		her.  Now why don't you pay me?

	She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(stopping her)
		Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just
		give me the address and then you go.

<b>				HONEY
</b>			(suddenly hard as nails)
		Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
		want sex or not, but you're payin' for
		my time.

	Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
	the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
	furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Give me the address!!

<b>				HONEY
</b>		Alright, alright - don't hurt me! 
		Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

	Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
	with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!

	Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.  He
	WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
	the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,
	rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts
	toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
	Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as
	Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
	tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
	her!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg
	films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...

<b>	THE KITCHEN KNIFE
</b>
	As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. 
	Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
	her face.  Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
<b>	INTO:
</b><b>		
</b><b>		INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.

<b>				JORDY (O.S.)
</b>		Her lips are fuller than that.  You can
		see 'em a mile away.

<b>	WIDER
</b>
	Food containers are scattered all over the place.  The female
	COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.  Stacks of failed sketches
	sit beside her.

<b>				COMPOSITE ARTIST
</b>		What about her cheek bones?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Her cheek bones are prominent and her
		eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when
		I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she
		was looking to get away.  But she was
		absolutely beautiful.

	The composite artist looks at Jordy.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		I gotta good look at her.

	Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
	watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
	landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.  Garcia is also on the
	phone.  The other investigators are gone.  Working late into
	the night.  Everybody's exhausted.  It's almost dawn.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long
		have they been livin' in your building?  
			(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
		Alright, I'll be in touch when we know
		somethin'.
			(to Jordy)
		Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
		quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord
		don't know who your girl is.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		How long they been livin' here?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		You hear that question, Garcia?

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
		they've been here illegally.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Well, they're definitely permanent
		residents now.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		I got the owner of the plumbing company
		Milos worked for.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
		see him in the morning.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You go home.  I'm takin' your car and
		goin' back to the crime scene.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Aren't you tired?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		If I go home I won't be able to fall
		asleep anyway.

	Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
	and heads for the door.  Korfin falls in behind him.  As they
	pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>			(of the picture)
		She keepin' you up?  Like to meet her,
		huh?  She'd make you forget your ex
		wife.  Cure your insomnia.

<b>	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN
</b>
	CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
	what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment.  The roof has
	been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
	through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Okay to smoke?

	Jordy turns, surprised.  Eddie sits on a singed chair.  He
	pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
	soup' container, smoking a cigar.  On the arm of the armchair
	is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
	crime scene and the burned bodies.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		It's your crime scene now.  You can do
		what you want.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Watch the news?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Nah, I musta missed it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys
		the credit.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Well, just so you know, I don't care
		about that stuff.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Nah, why should you?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I don't even watch TV.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Good.  Good.  Commendable.

	Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Did you get a report from the M.E.?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Sure.  But I would like to ask you
		something.  You got a problem with me?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		If you found me steppin' on your crime
		scene - it might piss you off, too.
			(then)
		What about the report?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You were right, they were both dead
		before the fire.  The male was stabbed
		so hard the killer broke off the tip of
		the knife in his spine.  That's usually
		an indicator of something personal.

	Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		The Super said he'd seen her before but
		she didn't live here.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Pretty.

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(acts as if he didn't notice)
		Hmmmm.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Maybe you don't care about that either.
			(beat)
		Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Who says she's a suspect?

	Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What would you call her?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
		to do with this.  I saw her outside
		after the fire - thought it was a lead. 
		Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was
		visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

	Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Obviously they weren't having sex.  As
		you pointed out.  So why go through all
		the trouble of putting 'em like that?

	Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
		trying to send a message.  Burial rites
		are taken very seriously in Eastern
		Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. 
		Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
		it's like condemning them to hell.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? 
		Hungary?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been
		fighting the Germans and the Russians
		for a thousand years.  These are very
		intense people and they take things
		personally.

	Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? 
		Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.
			(to Jordy)
		We've got another murder - in a hotel on
		Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said
		the room was rented by a Russian...

	Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. 

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'll come with you.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		There wasn't a fire.  There'll be
		nothing for you to do.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll
		learn something.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		This isn't homicide school.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		My parents are from Poland.  I can help
		with the Eastern European angle.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You're Polish?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		My folks are.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Stay here.
<b>						
</b>
<b>	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY
</b>
	Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
	picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.  Eddie's photo is on
	the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. 
	Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
	FLEMMING'S ON IT."  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
	standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
	front page.  The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
	Oleg himself.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		This is second day in America.  First
		day was very exciting.  Full of thrills
		and chills.  Over there, is co-star of
		my new movie, Emil!

	He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(to vendor)
		Who is he?

<b>				VENDOR
</b>		New York's finest.  This is his case.

	The VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the
	cover.

<b>				VENDOR (CONT'D)
</b>		This all you want?  

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Do you know how much killer gets for
		movie rights?

<b>				VENDOR
</b>			(People)
		In here, says he wants a million.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Million?!  The killer gets one million
		dollars for a television interview?

<b>				VENDOR
</b>		Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
		serial killer - half a million for his
		interview.  And how much you think
		Monica got for writing book about the
		President coming on to her?  It pays to
		be a killer or a whore in this country. 
		Look, you want magazine or not?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yes.  Both.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		And these.

	Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. 
	Emil pays for everything.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(to Oleg)
		Get a taxi.

	Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
	and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old
	BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light's blinking
<b>	WALK.
</b>
<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Let me help.

	Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.

<b>				BLIND WOMAN
</b>		Thank you, son.

	Emil watches her walk on.

<b>	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the
	dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and
	putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie
	enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
	the doorway taking pictures.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Where is she?

<b>				LEON
</b>		Takin' a bath.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Any I.D.?

<b>				LEON
</b>		Still unknown but we're running prints. 
		Kid over there caught the case.

	Jordy enters.  Leon steps in his way.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		Sorry...PD only.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		It's okay.

	Eddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only
	26, is excited to meet Eddie.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. 
		Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got. 
		A girl in there, figure her to be a
		prostitute, looks like she was fighting
		for her life.  She's got defense wounds
		on her hands.  Right this way - in the
		bathroom.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		After you.

	Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There's blood
	splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey's topless
	body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. 
	MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
	body.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. 
		Who said he sounded Russian?

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		The clerk?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Check the switchboard, see what phone
		calls were made from this room.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		I'll do it.

	Tommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides
	out what's left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at
	Honey's body in the bathtub.  Gil's dusting the tub for
	prints.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub
		is dry except for the blood.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Any of you guys take a piss lately?

	Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Do the seat for me.

	Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie
	stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the
	unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Only one guys checked in?

<b>				LEON
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide
		school?  Here - make yourself useful.

	Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Our killer...our killer's standing here
		slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. 
		The blood is splattering this way.  It's
		on this wall...
			(pointing to the right of
			 Jordy)
		And there's some specks over here.
			(to the left of Jordy)
		There's nothing here because someone was
		standing right here.  Someone big.  And
		he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. 
		He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
			(turning to Murphy)
		Murphy, what kind of knife you think
		we're talking about here?

	Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
	blood-splattered wall.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If you look here where he missed and hit
		the wall you see that the marks aren't
		deep but they're kinda wide... not your
		everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What if the tip was broken off?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Could be.  Then we should find it here
		somewhere.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I think we've already found it.

	Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
	detective, returns.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		There was only one call from this room
		last night.  I dialed it.  It's an
		escort service.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Did you identify yourself?

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Call communications and get an address
		on that number.

	Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
	address on it.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Good work.

<b>	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
</b>
	Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You goin' to the escort service?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You got any better ideas?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Mind if I ride along with you?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		This has nothing to do with your fire.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		But what if it does?  You might need my
		help.

	As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
		my son?

<b>	EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY
</b>
	Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
	the man's back.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I'll let you know what happens.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in
		your way - we can talk the case over.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. 
		If you win you can come with me.  If you
		don't win, you don't come.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'll call it... tails.

	Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads.

	Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Heads.  See, you lost twice.
			(beat)
		Okay.  Get in.

	Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy
	can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the
	sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time
	lets Jordy get in.


<b>				WHIP PAN TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door.  Eddie knocks
	and flips a coin to Jordy.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Oh here.  A souvenir.

	Jordy takes the quarter.  Not understanding what Eddie means. 
	He looks at the quarter.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Two heads.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Better than one.

	Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.  Jordy reacts.  Eddie
	laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.  Knocks again.  We hear
<b>	ROSE HELLER.
</b>
<b>				ROSE (O.S.)
</b>		Who's there?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Police.  We'd like to ask you a few
		questions.

<b>				ROSE (O.S.)
</b>		I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna
		contact my attorney...

<b>				EDDIE
</b>			(commands)
		Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective
		Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

	Rose reacts.  Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
	door!  

<b>				ROSE
</b>		You!  I've seen you on TV!

	Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.

<b>				ROSE (CONT'D)
</b>		C'mon in.  C'mon in!

<b>	INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	They enter.

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don't have
		a camera.  Hold on a second.

	Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
	in Afrikaner.  We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.  Eddie
	looks around - taking in the place.  FOUR GIRLS are on
	phones.  Two girls take orders for customers.  The other two
	work the phone sex lines.  Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
	Eddie and Jordy:

<b>				ROSE (CONT'D)
</b>		What's wrong?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
		your girls was killed last night at the
		King Edward Hotel.

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Do you remember the man who called?

	Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Yeah.  He wanted a girl from
		Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
		'cause once they get there, you know, it
		doesn't really matter - Honey was
		killed...?  Poor girl...

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Do you have any Czech girls working for
		you?

<b>				ROSE
</b>		No.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Did you tell him you did?

	A BUTCH GIRL enters.  Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.

<b>				ROSE
</b>			(Afrikaner)
		Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What are you saying?

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me
		about her, too.

	Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		This her?

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,
		gave her my card.  She said she'd think
		about it but I never heard from her.

<b>				BUTCH GIRL
</b>			(Afrikaner)
		Beautiful eyes.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Who came by looking for her?

<b>				ROSE
</b>		He said he was her cousin.  I told him
		where she works.  They were just here.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Describe him.

<b>				ROSE
</b>		Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second
		guy with him was...shorter, with a
		wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn
		his videocamera off me.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		He had a videocamera?  Where is she? 
		Quickly!

<b>				ROSE
</b>		She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
		on 63rd and Madison.

<b>	EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
	As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.

<b>	INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
	Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
	astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up
	his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. 
		Hair salon.  Ludwig's. 

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(overlapping)
		I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 
		63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
		there already.

	Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer
	he was holding between his legs - finishes it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You thirsty?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm on duty.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>			(drinking)
		So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and
		you cover the back.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Of course.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I
		was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a
		door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
		yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! 
		What'd you dream about?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I wanted to run up to a building on
		fire, kick in the door, rush into the
		smoke and save a kid.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Then I guess we're doin' this the right
		way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a
		burning building I'll gladly let you go
		first.

	Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.

<b>	INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY
</b>
	We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
	it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.

<b>				OLEG (O.S.)
</b>		Daphne Handlova?

<b>				RECEPTIONIST
</b>		Daphne?  In the back.  Probably
		shampooing a customer's hair.

	Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the
	owner, is with her.

<b>				LUDWIG
</b>		Why are you messing with your hair color
		again?  You're going to kill your hair. 
		You won't look good with black hair.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I want to do it, alright?

<b>				LUDWIG
</b>		Well, then do it after work.  A
		customer's waiting.

	He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns
	on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She
	backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!

<b>	TO THE BACKYARD
</b>
	There's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. 
	Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the
	corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen
	knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
	the broken tip against her throat.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I...I have a temper.

	She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		When I lose it, I lose control.  I
		didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
		from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to
		prison, they beat me.  I still didn't
		tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos
		like a brother...

	The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
	softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>			(in English)
		I'm not a killer.

	The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as
	Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil
	leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.

<b>				LUDWIG
</b>		Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		In a minute, Ludwig.

	Ludwig leaves.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a
		whore.  But washing hair?  This is no
		job for a woman as beautiful as you. 
		They should be washing your hair.

	Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
	it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		I don't want to kill you.  But if you
		talk, I will.
			(whispers)
		I thought you'd want these.

	He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.  Oleg
	follows.  Jordy arrives.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		...Daphne?

	She says nothing.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me
		from the other night?  You are Daphne,
		right?

	She says nothing.  Eddie arrives.  Daphne turns.  Recognizing
	Eddie.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You don't have to be afraid.  We're here
		to protect you.  Come with me.  We want
		to talk to you.  You speak English
		alright?

	Eddie looks at Jordy.  Takes Daphne by the arm.
<b>		
</b><b>		EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
	her hand.  He reaches for her hand.  Opens it.  It's a
	brushed gold necklace.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Did he give you these?  Was he just
		here?

	Eddie searches the streets.  Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
	corner.  Oleg is videotaping him.  Leon and Tommy pull up. 
	Korfin behind.  They all pop out.  Eddie grabs Leon -
	squeezes his arm - quietly.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		The other side of the street.  The guy
		with the videocamera.
			(back to Jordy)
		Don't look - put her in the car.
			(to Leon)
		Stay this side.

<b>				LEON
</b>			(back to Tommy)
		Stay with her.

	They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
	attention of Oleg and Emil.

<b>	A VIDEO CLOSE-UP
</b>
	of the scene from across the corner.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(Czech)
		Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go!

	Emil starts to flee.

<b>	EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
	Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
	Emil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
	breath.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Split up!

	Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. 
	Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. 
	They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
	missing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.

	Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the
	corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon
	crashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the
	gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. 
	People are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon's wallet. 
	He is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Emil, look!

	Oleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward
	them - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is
	blown backwards.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

	Eddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
	blood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
	shot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Are you hit?

<b>				LEON
</b>		No.  I'm okay.

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(to Korfin)
		Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

	Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. 
	Cars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at
	Emil, who is almost two blocks away.  It's an impossible
	shot, out of range.

	But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two
	blocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
	astonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. 
	Runs.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. 
	Dabs Leon's wounds.

<b>				LEON
</b>		He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming
		the whole time!

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't
		worry, we'll get those fuckers.
<b>						
</b>
<b>				DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	EMS VEHICLE
</b>
	Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
	an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
	bloody face.  Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
	restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
	her cameraman.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Detective - can you tell us what
		happened here?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I can't talk right now.  We have some
		things to take care of.

	Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
	Nicolette.

	Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
	maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is
	where Eddie and Jordy are headed.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		I understand, but I noticed that the
		Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
		somehow related to the fire department?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I really can't give out any information
		right now at this point.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.  But I do understand that your
		partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. 
		Is that correct?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll
		be fine.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Do you have the suspect in custody?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Um...now is not a good time, okay. 
		Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. 
		I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
		Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>			(to cameraman)
		Alright, cut, cut, cut.

	Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
	shoulder.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>			(to Eddie)
		Eddie, are you okay?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Alright.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Alright?

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Alright.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Alright.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.

	Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her,
	then enters.

<b>	INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
	Jordy talks to Daphne. 

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I told your partner, I can't help.  I
		didn't see anything.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know
		these people?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower
		was broken, she let me use theirs.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Go on.

	She says nothing.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
		out.  Better if it comes from you.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		If I tell you, will you arrest me?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Arrest you for what?  Why would we
		arrest you?

	She still hesitates.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

<b>				JORDY
</b>		She just saw two of her friends killed! 
		They probably threatened her.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Is that all there is?

	She looks at Eddie.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Are you here illegally?  Don't worry
		about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. 
		They won't deport you.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

	She clams up.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Why not?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Something back home?

	Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across
	from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		...my little sister and I shared a flat -
		I came home one night and a man was
		raping her.  His gun was on the chair...
		He came at me and I shot him.

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(optimistic)
		Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Yes, but he was a cop.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		A cop?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>			(beat)
		I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like
		the South here.  The Police is right, a
		civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Look, we can help you but right now we
		have to deal with what's happening here. 
		Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(to Eddie)
		Can I talk to you?

	Eddie steps away with Jordy.  Keeping his eyes on Daphne. 
	She tries to listen.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		She's fucked.  Even if that story is
		true.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Raw deal.

	Eddie tilts his head.  Measures Jordy.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I
		get, they're all yours.  Just let me
		have a first crack at her.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You wanna talk to her alone?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What would your girlfriend think of
		that?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I don't have a girlfriend.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		My point exactly.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm serious here.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		So am I.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're
		a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You're her Savior?  Is she the kid
		you're gonna save from the burning
		building?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You know what I'm saying here.

	Eddie looks at his watch.  Thinks it over.  Measures Jordy.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
		head start.  You take her to the station
		house.  Don't let her out of your sight. 
		She's the only warm body we got left.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Hey.  I'm a professional.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Women like that have a way of turning
		professionals into amateurs.

	He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.

<b>	INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
	Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
	stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
	pink flesh taken out of his ankle.  Emil grabs some toilet
	paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
	with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.  He grits teeth
	in pain.  The lights go out.  Then Oleg adjusts the
	fluorescent light above the sink.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's
		more moody... like a scene from THE
<b>		THIRD MAN.
</b>
<b>				EMIL
</b>		Shut up.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Does it hurt?

	Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		This is nothing.

	Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Don't want to film this?

	We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
	expression, it's horrible.

<b>	INT. JORDY'S CAR - DAY
</b>
	Daphne rides in the backseat.  Jordy's watching her in the
	rearview.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Now I become custody of police
		department?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
		they'll help you with your situation.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I will if they don't send me back.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		They won't until this is over.

	She looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling
	her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Are you married?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Divorced.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Do you live alone?
			(beat)
		I've been in these clothes since...the
		killings.  Could we stop at your place? 
		I could take a shower...before I go into
		custody?

	Jordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to
	manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
	all the shit starts.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I can't take you to my place.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Somewhere else?

	Jordy looks at her...
<b>		
</b>
<b>	EDDIE
</b>
	Staring right at us.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I want to talk to you about something
		serious.

	He holds up the diamond engagement ring.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		I want to live the rest of my life with
		you...I don't know you've been married
		before and I've never been married, but
		I do love you, and...

	Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
	proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. 
	Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
	tonic.

<b>				PAULIE
</b>		She's here.

	Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. 
	He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and
	hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps
	Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his
	coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens
	himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
	drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie
	hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
	exits.  Paulie follows.

<b>	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
	It's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a
	table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
	the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. 
	Gives him a kiss on the cheek.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Hey, honey.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Hey.

	She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
	down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look
	at each other.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at
		me?  I just wanted a statement.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I can't...I can't answer you just
		because you want me to answer you!

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		You didn't have to embarrass me in front
		of my colleagues.  You could give me
		something.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you,
		sweetheart?  Oh...

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Stop it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
		the cameras and say, do you mind if we
		just work something out?

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't
		patronize me.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I'm not.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Yes you are.  I'm not just some
		reporter.  I don't just stick a
		microphone in your face.  You could give
		me something.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah, well you took the camera and put
		it right down on the evidence.  That
		was...

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		That was good.  You were holding the
		evidence.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You were merciless.  You didn't give a
		shit if you got me or not.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Well, who was it that taught me how to
		do that?  Huh?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You're ruthless.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		You're not so bad yourself.

	They look at each other.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		C'mere.

	They kiss.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Look at this.  You have blood on your
		shirt.  Whose is it?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Could be Leon's.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Jesus.  And last week you came over with
		blood on your shoes.  What am I going to
		do with you?

	Eddie takes her hand.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
		might look nice with another pair of
		shoes next to them in the closet.

	She looks at him.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
		before.  My first wife was a
		professional woman, didn't have time for
		children.  My second wife...I never
		wanted to go home to her.

	Nicolette's phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
	phone.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		What are you doing?  What are you
		saying?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Eddie?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Don't worry about the damn phone.  I
		won't answer it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Answer the phone.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		No.  Tell me what you want to say.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Answer it.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for
		a second.  They only call me when it's
		an emergency.  Just hold that thought.
			(into the phone)
		Can you call back?

<b>				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get
		in a cab.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		What're you talking about?

<b>				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We
		can't find her.  You gotta anchor the
		5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

	The line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to
	Eddie.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They
		want me to anchor tonight!

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		That's good.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Well, that's great.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go
		now, we're in the middle of something
		here.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to
		know what you're talking about.  You
		know, the shoe thing and the marriages
		and...

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it
		tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll
		talk.  We'll talk.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Promise?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be
		great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just
		imagine that, uh... Just look into the
		lens and imagine you're talking to me.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're
		not patronizing me.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		I love you.

	They kiss.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Okay, til tonight.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Tonight.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		You promise?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah.  I promise.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by
		my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
		and maybe just test them out next to
		yours...How's that... Would that be a
		good thing.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Okay.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		See you later.  Good luck.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Don't be late.

	She walks out.

<b>	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY
</b>
	Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire
	station is empty.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		The men are out of quarters - practicing
		putting out fires.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		So...the station is empty?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Yeah.  This way.

	He gestures toward the stairs.

<b>	INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes
	never leaving Jordy's.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You considered becoming a prostitute?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Yes, I considered it.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Did you ever turn tricks before?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		No.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		What about back home?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		No.

	Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close.

<b>				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
</b>		I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no
		one.  I couldn't get a job because you
		have to have a green card to get work. 
		They approached me - I could've made a
		lot of money.  I considered it, but...
		it's not who I am.  They pay me below
		the table at Ludwig's.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		So you were never a prostitute?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		What are you asking me?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm just trying to find out who you are.

	She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's
	hinting.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Can you let me go?

	She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
	kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
	and backs up slightly.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Showers are this way.

	Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
	closer.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		You could shower with me.

	Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks
	away.  Gestures towards the showers. 
	Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the
	showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are
	lined with shower stalls.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.

	He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the
	window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the
	street.

<b>	JORDY
</b>
	gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He
	checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We
	follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he
	notices the window.  It's open.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Shit!

	He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -
	looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through
	the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -
	quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain
	aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding
	herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Are you alright?

	Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I know.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was
		desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a
		cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to
		me when I got to prison?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		They're not gonna send you right back.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. 
		Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this
		time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look
		anyone in the eyes. 
		Always afraid that someone would find
		out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

	He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You can trust me.

	She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a
	moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.

	on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets
	down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands
	abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls
	back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is
	taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
	teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
	over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews
	them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a
	beer.

	Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
	"People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. 
	Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the
	videocamera tilts back up to his face.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		What is it?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
		you to erase it.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I did.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		And the whore's murder?  You didn't
		erase that either, did you?  Don't lie,
		I won't be angry.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Why not?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Put the camera down, Oleg.

	Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil
	removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks
	up Eddie Flemming's name.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		What is that?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		What does it look like?  It's an address
		book!

	Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Let me get a shot of it.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Sit down!

<b>				OLEG
</b>		This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

	Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		Why won't you be angry at me for keeping
		my movie?

	Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
	away.  Oleg follows.

</b>
<b>	INT. PRECINCT - DAY
</b>
	It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's
	desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more
	aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting
	Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns
	and sees Jordy and Daphne.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Hey.  Warsaw.

	Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		I came to see how the investigation was
		going.
			(looks at Daphne)
		I called and you're not here.  I wait up
		at the station and you don't even show
		up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my
		call.  Where the hell have you been?!

	Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. 
		We stopped there... so she could get
		cleaned up.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I let her take a shower.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		No!  Nothing happened.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a
		homicide witness to take a shower after
		your partner was shot?  Are you out of
		your fucking mind??  Are you having that
		much trouble gettin' dates?!

<b>				EDDIE (O.S.)
</b>		I told him to take her there.

	Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy -
	the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
	Hotel - is coming out of the back office.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Tommy, get her outta here.

	Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		This way, ma'am.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		There was too much press hangin' around
		there.  I didn't want her face on the
		news.  So I told him to take her to a
		quiet area until things settled down.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Oh.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		It was my decision, not his.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
		and every now and then I'd like to be
		included in decisions.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
		the press conference.  How about that? 
		The case is all yours.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Oh yeah...?  Alright.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>			(to Jordy)
		I'm ready to be briefed.
			(to Duffy)
		Excuse us.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>			(to Eddie)
		Yeah, sure.
			(to Jordy)
		Beep me when you're ready for the press
		conference.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Will do, Chief.

	Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk -
	toward the back and to his office.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Eddie, I...

	Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Wait.

<b>	INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY
</b>
	A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. 
	Eddie enters with Jordy.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Guys...give me a few minutes?

	They empty out.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't
		touch her.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna
		believe you didn't...including me.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I took her there for a shower and that's
		it.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Just a shower?

	Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing
		happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably
		think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		No, I don't think you were a fool, I
		just think you were stupid about it.  I
		mean, to say the least, you outta know
		better.  You don't know her well enough. 
		She's got the potential to fucking hang
		you even if she suggests that you made a
		pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can
		deny it all you want, but it will not
		make one fucking bit of difference. 
		You're dead.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I told you, you know, I thought I was
		doing the right thing, you know, I think
		she's innocent.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Well, it's not up to you to decide
		whether she's innocent or not.  Don't
		you understand, that's why you're a
		professional.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
		limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
		heard her there.  Tellin' her whole
		story...I believed her.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		How you go out on a limb for somebody is
		by giving her a number of an Immigration
		lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an
		Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help
		her. 
		But you can't get involved in her like
		that.  You're gonna jeopardize your
		career, your life and you're gonna
		jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you
		another piece of advice.  Maybe you
		don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
		little secret - the whole fuckin' world
		watches television.  And when you get
		out there, they know your face.  And the
		little fame, the little fuckin' itty
		bitty fame that I get in this city makes
		it a lot easier for my job.  And I get
		more done because of it.

	Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Why'd you help me back there with the
		Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like
		that?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You know, I don't know.  I like you. 
		You remind me of a puppy I used to have. 
		He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
		still kept him.

	Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in
	his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the
	match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The
	homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.

</b>
<b>	INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the
	door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did
		they check the hospitals?  Airports? 
		Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We
		should be all over everywhere - with
		dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys
		are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...

	He looks at the flowers.  Decides to put the case behind him
	for a moment.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		I'll call you later.

	He HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look
	perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card,
	writes, "Nicky, I love you. 
	Will you marry me?"  He sticks the card in the flowers -
	turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
	the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a
	drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
	flowers.  There's a knock at the door.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Coming!

	Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is
	empty.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Nicky!?!?

	No answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
	his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn't notice the
	shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. 
	Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone.

<b>				EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>		Nicky?!

	He walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the
	door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
	head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!

<b>	A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE
</b>
	as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
	to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting
	in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the
	flowers in a vase.  They've ransacked the place.  Emil has
	Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.  He's smoking
	one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
	engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
	positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the
	corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
	Eddie's face.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		So...who's Nicky?

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		What do you want?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Your opinion.
			(leaning forward)
		You see, they going to make a movie
		about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>			(sarcastic)
		What's your accomplishment.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I kill someone famous.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		Then do it, asshole.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who
		plays you will want to die like hero.

	Eddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie's look.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		So tabloids don't have to do re
		enactments.  They going to have real
		movie this time.

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		If you kill me and film it you're
		putting a noose around your neck.

	Emil turns to Oleg.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Turn it off.

	Oleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy
		men would film their murders?
			(gestures to Eddie)
		So we kill someone famous and if we are
		caught, we are sent to mental hospital. 
		But what good is money there?  Because
		once in hospital I say I not crazy. 
		Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see
		psychiatrists.  They must certify we are
		sane and because of your - what is law
		called?
			(Eddie says nothing)
		Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double
		Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
		crime twice.  We come out free, rich and
		famous!

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Good idea!

<b>				EDDIE
</b>		You really think you'll be able to fool
		a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'
		stupid are you?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry
		baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
		will Americans believe me, they'll cry
		for me.
			(laughs)
		So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
		like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? 
		Maybe you can propose to her now?

	Eddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on
	Eddie's cigar.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Okay.  He has nothing to say.
			(signaling Oleg)
		Start the camera!

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Cut!

	Emil looks at Oleg.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action!'

	Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
	with."  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		And...action!

	Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie
	suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
	backing out of Eddie's reach.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Bad last moment - I cut that out.

	Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
	left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
	gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing
	and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
	into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
	Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

	Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around
	with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
	him to the wall.

	Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
	Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
	with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
	repeatedly.

	Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
	from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
	onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
	leaving Oleg on the sofa.

	Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
	in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
	gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
	not clear in the darkness who has the gun.

	Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
	videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
	as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
	toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
	window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

	Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
	toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
	the stomach.

	Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
<b>	STOMACH.
</b>
	Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
	the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got
	stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be
	dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain
	is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
	close up.

	Emil looks at Eddie.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Die.  Die.

	Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
	off, suffocating him.
<b>		
</b>
<b>	BLACKNESS
</b>
	We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
	feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,
	in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. 
	We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
	tiny pixel on a TV screen.

<b>	WIDENING
</b>
	further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's
	an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
	dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
	over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
	his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
	the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio
	from Eddie's funeral.

<b>				NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
</b>		..Detective Flemming was one of the most
		decorated NYPD detectives in the history
		of New York.  He made several thousand
		arrests during his career, including the
		famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by
		the community in which he served.  His
		partner eulogized him...

	Leon is at the mic. 

<b>				LEON (ON T.V.)
</b>		...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
		and my partner...he taught me the
		meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man
		in every sense of the word.  I'll miss
		him...
			(choking on tears)
		Sleep well, brother.

	Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."  Oleg PANS from the TV
	and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -
	carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long
	hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
	pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. 
	Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,
	the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
	table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
	revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

<b>	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
	It's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many
	who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black
	ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -
	boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet
	has been laid out.

	Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He
	greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Awful...what an awful day.  He was New
		York City.

	Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's
	Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		I never got to tell him how much I
		admired him.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

	Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of
	the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves
	to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at
	him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. 
	Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		You know...you know he was gonna propose
		to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd
		written out to me.  And a ring
		box...these fuckers that killed him -
		have my ring.  They have my diamond
		engagement ring...

	Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I know.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		What do you mean you know?  He told you
		he was gonna propose to me?

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Well, he...

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>			(overriding)
		I want to hear everything he said.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I'm trying to tell you.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Alright.  Go ahead.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		That morning.  He was talking to me and
		Leon about marriage.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. 
		He started making overtures - talking
		about little shoes next to his in his
		closet but I got a call to anchor - and
		I walked out on him.  I walked out on
		him when he was trying to ask me to
		marry him!!

	Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		I'd never had a great relationship
		before.  I'd never made great choices
		with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to
		know.  He was older, my parents told me
		I was nuts to get involved with him. 
		But he was so great to me.  Always
		encouraging, telling me I could do
		anything...
			(beat)
		He was the one.  You know, I'd give up
		everything - everything - for just a
		little more time.  I would've spent
		fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
		knew I had.

	She's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him
	off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A
	woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>		Robert...?

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		What are you doing here?

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>			(holding a cellular)
		You've got a call.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I can't talk to anybody right now, can't
		you see I'm busy!  I can't talk
		business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.
			(to Paulie)
		Get her a whiskey.

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>		Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

	Robert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Hello?  Who is this?
			(listens)
		How do I know this is you?

	Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. 
	Backs away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he
	looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.

<b>				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
</b>		Where?

	We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
	theater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
	glances into the theater.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the
		Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my
		next film.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>			(low)
		Look asshole.  I've been threatened by
		better than you.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened
		you.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I'll meet you on one condition - I get
		exclusivity and you surrender to me.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock
		gives you time to go to bank.  Three
		hundred thousand dollars.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		What?  It doesn't work that way.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(incensed)
		If you don't want my film - I'll call
		another show.  And they will show it.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk
		about surrendering.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the
	phone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. 
	Hawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.

<b>	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
	Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in
	a sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their
	dress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		How was it?

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(numb)
		Not good.

	Jordy's quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>			(nods to Daphne)
		Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>			(to Korfin)
		Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let
		her pick up her clothes and take her
		straight to Hoover Street.  You got
		that?

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Yeah.

	Jordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other's look.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Chief - mind if I take her?

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Okay.  But not water sports.

	Duffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. 
	Korfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
	who points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MAN
</b>			(shoving papers in Jordy's

		Consider yourself served.

	Jordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. 
	Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
		department and the city of New York for

	It's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. 
	Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Are you alright?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I'm sorry.

	He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the

		Hello.  How are you?

	She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne

		you find another girlfriend that isn't
		going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

	They're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension
	strong.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		A good Immigration lawyer could stall
		the process.  Eddie recommended one.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
		you.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm glad I met you.

	They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. 
	Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. 
	They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the
	hall.  Jordy clears his throat.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Let's get your stuff.

	He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to
	her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter.

<b>	INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	It's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. 
	The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking
	the same thought.  Another kiss. 

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You better get packed.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Right.

	She holds his look.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Do you have coffee?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		In the kitchen.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'll make some for us.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I'll get my clothes.

	She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He
	flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
<b>	SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
</b>	THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.

<b>				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
</b>		Jordy!!!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

	Jordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows
	the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices
	a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it
	at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne
<b>	SCREAMS!
</b>
<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		That's not mine!

	WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames
	leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
	because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy
	CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and
<b>	JORDY'S HAND.
</b>
	He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. 
	Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it
	under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He
	hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before
	the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. 
	Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
	chair through the window.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!

	Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in
	the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
	the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,
		make it quick, we're trapped!  8th
		Avenue and 44th Street.

	He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy
	kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that
	under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. 
	Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
	water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. 
	She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top
	of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

	Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.

<b>				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
</b>		They were here!

	This freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to
	panic.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get
		down!

	He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF
	GASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh Jesus!

	Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Pouring it out!

	She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The
	FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is
	beginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.

	Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
	wall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for
	leverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It's
	creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.

<b>				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh shit!

	Jordy looks over.  The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
	going down the drain.  It's stopped up.  As soon as the fire
	gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!

	Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. 
	Daphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break
	it off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. 
	SOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,
	soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. 
	Trying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are
	drenched.  And trapped.

	Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall
	behind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.

<b>	VIDEO POV
</b>
	Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. 
	CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.

<b>	OLEG
</b>
	is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.  Tenants from
	Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape.  Emil
	stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.  He turns the
	camera on himself.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		This is great film!  You can see fire
		right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
		Marshal is here.  Everything is so
		messy.  Everything is so crazy right
		here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 
		90% of people who die in fire die from
		eating smoke.  So most likely they all
		die from eating smoke.

	The CAMERA PANS to Emil.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		And this is the man who started the
		fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

	Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.

<b>	DAPHNE'S BATHROOM
</b>
	Filled with smoke.  You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. 
	Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
	in the apartment next door.  The smoke has a place to escape. 
	There's a 7-year old KID in there.  Standing in the bathroom. 
	Terrified.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! 
		Run!

<b>				7-YEAR OLD KID
</b>		The hallway is on fire!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to
		help you.  Get back!  Now!

	Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
	door catches fire.  It's seconds before the whole room will
	blow up.

<b>	OLEG
</b>
	Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!

<b>	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Fire engines have arrived.  The street is filled with
	gawkers.  Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
	the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
	with the other.  Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.  A
	fireman grabs the kid.  Another grabs Daphne.  Garcia and
	Korfin run to Jordy.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the
		hand!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Where's Daphne?  Daphne?

	He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
	through the crowd.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Isn't she a beauty?  She's my fire, look
		at that loom-up on her!

	Jordy turns - it's Max.  The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
	threw out of his office.  As a news crew arrives, Max turns
	to the cameras.

<b>				MAX
</b>		I did this!  I did this!  Take my
		picture!  I'm Max!  Max Gornick!

	Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Get outta here!

<b>				KORFIN
</b>		What the hell happened?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		They were inside.  They booby trapped
		her apartment!

	Korfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the
	b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		What the hell are you talking about??? 
		They're gonna do what?

	Jordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and
	is freaked.

<b>	INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	JORDY'S POV
</b>
	as he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still
	wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still
	in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
	producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>		He's not on the premises!

<b>				LEON
</b>		I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it
		here this minute.

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>		Any request for the video must be
		directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
		Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you
		his number.

	Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes
	past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward
	Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries
	to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
		I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
		shove it so far up your ass it'll come
		outta your mouth!

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>		I want your shield number!

<b>				HAWKINS (O.S.)
</b>		Viewer discretion advised!

<b>				MAGGIE
</b>			(pointing at the TV)
		You want the tape?  There it is!

	Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
	which is mounted in the lobby.  The "Top Story" logo flashes
	on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		What we are about to broadcast is very
		graphic footage...

	Everyone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
	Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins
	jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out.

<b>	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT
</b>
	POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
	popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
	table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the
	glass - looking into the lens.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		America!  Who says you can't be success
		in America?  I arrived with nothing,
		knowing nobody - now look - I am a
		success story!

	The videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks
	suspiciously.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		You are success story?  I am success
		story!  Why do you say I and not we?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a
		hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
		you?  I gave you half of what they gave
		me.  Look - here we are!

	Emil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in
	Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
	watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins
	is introducing his show.

<b>				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
</b>		Good evening.  Welcome to "Top Story". 
		Tonight, I present to you material of a
		graphic and violent nature never before
		seen on television.  And I do so with a
		heavy heart.  You will be first-hand
		witness to the slaying of celebrated New
		York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
		Flemming.  It would be only normal to
		ask, why?  Why are we showing something
		so journalist, I must show it.  A
		democracy survives through the freedom
		of its media, and if we cannot see what
		is happening then we don't deserve our
		democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie
		Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I
		watched this footage and vowed to fight
		this violence with every molecule of my
		being from this day onward.  Hopefully,
		this will have a similar effect on you. 
		One final word, this material is
		absolutely not appropriate for children.

	The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		In movie they make of us, who do you
		think would act me?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		The one who got caught in the bathroom.
			(beat)
		George Michael.

	Emil laughs.  Oleg doesn't.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I'm serious.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Shut up.  Look!

	Emil points towards the TV.  "Top Story" is continuing.  The
	scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to
	the chair.  The light illuminating his face.

<b>				OLEG (O.S.)
</b>		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action.'
			(beat)
		And 'action!'

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Bad last moment - I cut it out.

	Emil looks at Oleg - furious.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		I told you to cut that out before we
		handed in the tape!

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Be quiet.  Watch.

	Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
	Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then
	knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
	the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
	Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie
	and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the
	way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. 
	Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and
	he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The
	blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
	light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down
	for a CLOSE-UP.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Die.  Die.

<b>	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Hawkins' van drives across Times Square.  Jordy's car
	following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
	on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned.

<b>	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at
	Oleg.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Why did you leave that stuff in about
		you being the director?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Because I am the director.  Don't you
		realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
		my talent, my idea to do this - no way
		would we be sitting here right now.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

	Oleg tenses.  Emil laughs.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Aren't you just the cameraman?

	Oleg doesn't laugh.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		I'm serious...this - this is a great
		American film.  Full of violence and
		sex.  And I want my credit.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Credit?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -
		I put titles on it and my credit is
		going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yes.  But there's only one problem - you
		want credit but the problem is - I don't
		share credit.

	Oleg is pissed.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		You got that?

<b>				OLEG
</b>		No, I don't get that!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		You think you are a director?  You are a
		fucking little, small Russian piece of
		shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate
		you.

	Emil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil
	suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
	trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a
	shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
	runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It's chaos. 
	Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
	confident, tough criminal attorney.

	Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
	pressing it to his wound.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh, hello.

	Cutler accesses the situation.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Are you my attorney?
			(extends his hand to Cutler)
		I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I'm not your lawyer until I see the
		money.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Here.  I have your money.

	Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler
	opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. 
	Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
	aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
	freaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh no!  No!  Shit!

<b>				CUTLER
</b>			(follows Emil - reaching out to
			 him)
		Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit
		down.  What do you need?  What are you
		looking for?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		He has the camera!  He took the movie!

	Jordy comes in, gun raised.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands
		up!  Drop it!

	Emil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I give up!

	Jordy is disappointed!  He didn't want to take Emil alive. 
	Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
	Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		This man is unarmed, officer.  He's
		surrendered.

	Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		What are you hitting him for?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Turn that camera off!

	Jordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
	appearing more hurt than he is.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		No.  Keep filming...

	Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
	that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up -
	dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
	favoring his ankle.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>			(to Emil)
		Don't say anything.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Where are we going?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I'm coming with you.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yes.  Yes, come with me!

<b>				CUTLER
</b>			(to Jordy)
		I'm invoking rights - this man is
		represented by counsel.  I'm coming with
		him.

	The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything. 
	Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video
	footage.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Turn that camera off!

<b>	EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. 
	Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
	to his car.  Leon grabs Emil.

<b>				LEON
</b>		I'll take him.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		No way!  He's mine!

<b>				LEON
</b>			(holding on to Emil, squeezing
			 his arm hard)
		We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		He's my collar!

<b>				LEON
</b>		Well, he killed my partner!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		He's yours but I take him in!  I'll
		drive him to the precinct, you can have
		him but I'm walkin' him in.

	Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
	custody.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll
		follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

	Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
		goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile
		when they put you down!

	Cutler hurries to Emil's side.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his
		taunting!
			(to Leon)
		He's represented by counsel.  You want
		to speak to someone - you speak to me!

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Out of the way, counselor.

	Tommy shoves Cutler aside.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Don't you put your hands on me,
		Detective.

	Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon
	turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.

<b>				LEON
</b>		And you, you'll pay for what you did!

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>			(low)
		This footage will work in your favor. 
		When the jury sees this - no matter what
		Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

	Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.

<b>				LEON
</b>		You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of
		yourself.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		If I didn't put it on somebody else
		would!  I was his friend!

<b>				LEON
</b>		Don't give me that fucking shit.

	The cameras are rolling.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Don't get into it on TV.

<b>				LEON
</b>			(yells to other cop cars)
		Alright, let's get going!

	Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already
	behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
	seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away.
<b>		
</b><b>	INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the
	lights.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose
		everybody!

	Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
	Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
	lane - having lost the police.

<b>				TOMMY (CONT'D)
</b>		Where are you goin'??  This ain't the
		way to the station!

	Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.

<b>	EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.  They are way uptown in the
	middle of nowhere.  The car drives down a dark street.  
	Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
	no people around.

<b>	EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
	going on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.  Pulls open the back
	door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
	deserted tunnel.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can't do
		this.  This isn't the way to do things.

	Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Were you a fireman?  That how you knew
		how to rig the apartment?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		My father was.  He gave me many lessons
		about fire.  Now it's my friend.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Tommy, take a walk.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		What are you gonna do?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna
		get caught!  That's why he videotaped
		Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
		get off.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Don't stoop to his level!

	Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

<b>				JORDY
</b>			(erupting)
<b>		GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR
</b><b>		AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
</b><b>		KILL YOU, TOO!!!
</b>
	Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car.  Climbs behind
	the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
	the darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.  The one Emil
	took from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
	left.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
	Emil's belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
	center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
	throws them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
	around to face him.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

	Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
	same place he put Emil's.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		You wanna be a real American?  Go for
		your gun.

	Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
	the gun.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? 
		Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
		make more money.

	Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. 
		Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you
		never shot anybody in your life.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You'll be my first.

	Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
	Emil's eyes.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,
		look, you're sweating.  You don't have
		the balls.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Get down on your knees.

	Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.  SIRENS
	fill the air.  Police cars come flying down the street.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Where's your partner?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. 
		Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

	Leon runs up.  Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
	Emil.

<b>				LEON
</b>		Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him
		dead but you can't do it this way.

	Emil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
	face.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and
	speeds away.
<b>		
</b><b>		INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
	Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room.  Jordy
	follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.

<b>				WAITER
</b>		Do you really need me?

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this
		up.

	They reach the room.  Jordy flattens himself against the
	wall.  The waiter KNOCKS.

<b>				HOOKER'S VOICE
</b>		Who's there?

<b>				WAITER
</b>			(nervous)
		R-room service.

	A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
	out at the waiter.

<b>				HOOKER
</b>		Come in.

	Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
	the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom
	door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the
	bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked
	up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
	footage of the fire.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. 
		No cuts.
			(excited)
		And look.  Look at that transition. 
		That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?!

	Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Don't move!

	Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and
	picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of
	the hookers for protection.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Drop the girl!  Drop her!!

	Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
	the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes
	out into the

<b>	HOTEL HALLWAY
</b>
	Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
	the stairwell.

<b>	EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs
	through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases
	him, gun in hand!

	Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
	cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. 
	Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. 
	Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
	underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding
	the camera in his hand.  It's on.

<b>				JORDY
</b><b>		STOP!  STOP THAT MAN!
</b>
	A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking
	him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:

<b>	INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.

<b>				TICKET TAKER
</b>		Hey, come back here!

	The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
	counter.  Jordy rushes in the door.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Where is he?  Where'd he go?

<b>				TICKET TAKER
</b>		Middle door.

	Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
	door - and enters the theater through the far door.

<b>	INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a
	night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. 
	He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.

<b>				DRUNK'S VOICE
</b>		Kill him!  Kill the bastard!

	Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start
	YELLING for blood!

<b>				AUDIENCE
</b>		Shoot him!  SHOOT!

	A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes
	the shots are coming from the screen.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		Look!  Over here!

	Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
	film Jordy's death with a videocamera. 
	Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
	the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
	and heads, bounding for the screen.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

	Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the
	audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg
	leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. 
	Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES
	back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
	clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy
	raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! 
	Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
	disappeared.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Shit!

	SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as
	they enter.

<b>	CLOSE ON TV
</b>
	A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
	theater.

<b>				REPORTER (ON T.V.)
</b>		...and the wild chase through Times
		Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
		Razgul, escaping.  The fire department
		has identified the fire marshal involved
		in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

	The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
	story.

<b>				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
</b>		In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's
		attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
		handling sensational cases - claims his
		client is unfit to stand trial.

<b>	INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY
</b>
	Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.  Watching TV
	through the bars.  She is in the fire department's holding
	cell in Brooklyn.

<b>				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
</b>		In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
		not the alleged mastermind behind the
		murders. 
		According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
		being directed by his partner, who
		threatened to kill him if he didn't
		follow Mr. Razgul's orders.  Cutler told
		reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
		fact stab his client.

	The scene CUTS TO Cutler's press conference.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. 
		What's happened is not his fault.  Emil
		was under the influence of his partner. 
		At the trial, you'll see that my client
		will be vindicated...

<b>	INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY
</b>
	The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.  We are now in an
	interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.  Emil
	sits at a small table - with Cutler.  Emil is dressed in
	Bellevue clothes.  He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. 
	Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I brought you some letters.  It's really
		fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
		buy you clothes, another sent a check. 
		Another wants a check.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		You bring the cigarettes?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Oh, sure.

	Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
	Emil's mouth and lights it for him.  Emil has never smoked
	before.

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		How're they treating you, alright
			(Emil is nonresponsive)
		I want to get the cuffs off... but
		there's a little bit of a problem. 
		Things out there are very negative right
		now for us.  We gotta change that
		around.  Perception is very, very
		important.  Perception is reality.  I
		know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's
		important that I get that message out. 
		Cause that's our only defense in this
		case.

	Emil leans forward.  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
	between his lips.

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		I want you to focus on three things:
		fear...

	He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		...delusions and paranoia.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I was all of these.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
		of it until recently.  No question about
		that.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		What about Oleg?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Disappeared.  They're looking
		everywhere.  Maybe he went back to
		Czechoslovakia.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		No, he is here.  Shit...

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Don't worry about him.  Think about
		yourself.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		What about my movie rights?  Book
		rights?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Look, I haven't really focused on that
		kind of thing.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		What's your cut?  How much?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I would say...half.  Half is fair.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(laughs)
		No.  No way.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		But it's...

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call
		another lawyer.  This is the biggest
		case of your life.  Don't try to
		negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or
		no.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		This is not about money, Emil.  I need
		your trust in me.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		What else do you need?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I need to know about your background.  I
		need to know about your upbringing.  Why
		you're here.

<b>				EMIL
</b>			(indicating cigarette)
		Give me another one, please.

	Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth.  Lights it.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Tell me about yourself.  What you did as
		a young boy... what your parents were
		like.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		My father always degraded me.  Killed my
		self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Your mother was blind?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. 
		She went to fucking black market doctor
		to induce me.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Back in the Czech Republic?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
		drugs which made her go blind.  And my
		father blamed me for her blindness...

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Your father blamed you for your mother's
		blindness?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
		born.  Put it out.  Can you put the
		cigarette out?

	Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
	it.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		That's what he did to me.  He put
		cigarettes out on me.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Your father put cigarettes out on you?

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Out on my back when I was a small boy.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		Can I see your back?

	Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS
<b>	ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
</b>	CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified.

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh, Jesus.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I'm abused.  Don't you think?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
		torture.

<b>	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy
	stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can
	see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a
	subpoena in his hand.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		The public doesn't have any idea what we
		do and now you're going to define our
		image!  This is going to be our Rodney
		King!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		What was I supposed to do?  The guy
		tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop
		back - I just forgot.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a
		tree?!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
		guy was no innocent civilian.

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		Well this is gonna end your career and
		probably mine.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		End my career?

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		How are you going to fight this?  Maybe
		if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
		been on the front page, as a hero, this
		thing would be easier to fight.  You'd
		have the good to weight against the bad! 
		It's unfortunate that I have to make
		decisions based upon your press coverage
		but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme
		your shield.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		But Chief?  Over this??

<b>				DUFFY
</b>		There's nothing to talk about.  Get a
		good lawyer.  You're suspended until
		your trial.

	Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops
	his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun
	- looks at it.

<b>				DUFFY (CONT'D)
</b>			(pats Jordy's shoulder)
		I know you got backup at home.  Drop it
		off.

	Jordy sighs and exits.

<b>	INT. IMMIGRATION &amp; NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In
	another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
<b>	U.S. ATTORNEYS.
</b>
<b>				STERN
</b>			(to Jordy)
		Look, what don't you understand?  We've
		got a good relationship with the Czech's
		and the State Department doesn't want to
		cause an incident.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

<b>				STERN
</b>		They've got her testimony on videotape. 
		And even if they do take her to court
		immediately after she'll be extradited. 
		The Czechs want her back.  She shot a
		cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
		Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
		Republic?  How would you feel if the
		Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!

	Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers
	his voice.

<b>				STERN (CONT'D)
</b>		And just between us...I was married to a
		redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are
		like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from
		both.

	Jordy gives him a look.

<b>				STERN (CONT'D)
</b>		You want to see her - go ahead.

	Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The
	assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		We're gonna fight the extradition.

	Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Forget about me.  You have enough
		problems of your own.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		...Do you really want me to forget about
		you?

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		I don't want to drag you down with me.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Daphne, I...

	Daphne touches her finger to his lips.

<b>				DAPHNE
</b>		Shhhh.

	She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,
	trying to find a smile.

<b>	EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY
</b>
	It's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
	frazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But
	she's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.

<b>				NICOLETTE 
</b>		...and today with his partner who he
		blamed for the crimes still at large,
		Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His
		lawyer will argue that he is mentally 
		unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News
		has also learned that later this month,
		Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
		in court.  He will be arraigned on
		charges of violating the civil rights
		of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Zwangendaba.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Goddamn assholes everywhere. 
		Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. 
		I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. 
<b>		5-4-3-2-1...
</b>
	She starts over.

<b>	INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	Jordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with
	his dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his
	eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
	Daphne. 
	His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. 
	As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
	seeps through her broadcast.

<b>				NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
</b>		Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
		descendent of the African King from whom
		he takes his name...

	Jordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy
	picks up.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Hello?
			(listens)
		No comment.

	He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.

<b>				JORDY (CONT'D)
</b>		Hello?
			(listens)
		No!

	Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert
	Hawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from
	someone - in a park - interviewing him.

<b>				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
</b>		He robbed you?

	The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
	suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He
	stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
	tree.  He's appearing on "Top Story".

<b>				ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
</b>		That's right, I encountered him right
		here.  I was just askin' for change an'
		he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
		up against that tree, whereupon he takes
		my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
		me there all exposed...

	The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
	the table and throws it through the window:

<b>	BACK TO TV
</b>
	as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him
	is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. 
	The reporter stands in front of the jail.

<b>				REPORTER
</b>		...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
		won't have to worry about how he is
		going to pay for his defense.  He has
		received movie offers and been in
		conversations with numerous publishers
		concerning the rights to his life story.

<b>	REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
	Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.


<b>	INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
</b>
	Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see
	the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He
	stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.

<b>	EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY
</b>
	Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the
	park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. 
	Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
	Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
	and sticks it in his pocket.

<b>	CLOSE ON METER
</b>
	to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.

<b>				TAXI DRIVER
</b>		I can't believe this guy got off. 
		Unbelievable.

	Jordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he
	crams it into the slot.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Whatever's leftover, keep.

	Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is
	coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is
	sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with
	rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up
	and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand
	grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

<b>	HIGH WIDE SHOT
</b>
	Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. 
	All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:

<b>	HAWKINS
</b>
	and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
	frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she
	looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a
	disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -
	anxious - looks at his cameraman.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he
		comes through the crowd.  Do you hear
		me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

<b>	THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP
</b>
	Cutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
	the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
	car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
	POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at
	Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		...my client was suffering from a major
		illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
		during times of intense stress, as a
		result of paranoid and psychotic
		delusions - there was impairment of his
		ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
		This is a victory for the mentally ill!

	Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on
	Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,
	the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? 
	Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam
	in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
	cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
	place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler
	continues:

<b>				CUTLER (CONT'D)
</b>		...before Emil boards the police boat
		and heads for Rykers Island where he
		will be checked into the psyche ward, I
		want to say one last word to you all...
		As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
		Razgul into committing these murders,
		yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
		free man, filming gruesome murders... My
		client and I hope he is brought to
		justice in the near future.

	They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
	Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
	obsessively.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

	Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. 
	Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		You think this is funny??  What the hell
		are you laughing at?

	Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the
	jacket.

<b>				CUTLER
</b>			(to a nearby escort)
		Officer, keep this man back, he's
		assaulted my client on previous
		occasions.

	A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		This is it?  This bastard kills the best
		cop this city ever had and we do
		nothing?

<b>				CUTLER
</b>		You may not like it marshal, but that's
		the law.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		And what about the other victims??  What
		about their families?  He'll end up in
		some country club nuthouse while his
		lawyer sells his rights to the movies
		and we just stand here and do nothing? 
		We let this scumbag walk?

	Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. 
	Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm
		insane.

	Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the
	cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

<b>	A VIDEO POV
</b>
	as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame
	tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who
	he's been waiting for.  His face lights up.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where
		is it?  Where is the tape?

<b>	IT'S OLEG
</b>
	In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.

<b>				OLEG
</b>		It's all in here.  All in here.

<b>	MEANWHILE JORDY
</b>
	has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
	cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some
		interesting evidence, something you
		should look at!

	Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he
	continues introducing his broadcast:

<b>				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
</b>		I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
		UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
		proving Emil Slovak was not insane! 
		Hard to believe...watch!

	Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
	videocamera up in the air.

<b>				OLEG (ON VIDEO)
</b>		He knew exactly what he was doing - all
		of this was planned!  It's all here in
		my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. 
		Look!

	Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
	of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:

<b>				EMIL (ON VIDEO)
</b>		...so we kill someone famous and if we
		are caught, we are sent to mental
		hospital...

<b>				CUTLER
</b>			(points to Oleg)
		Officers, there's your killer, do your
		duty, arrest him!

	The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
	reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the
	press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy
	notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE
	CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
	killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He
	yells at Oleg!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Traitor!!

<b>				OLEG
</b>		No.  You are the traitor.  You are
		murderer.  I am director.  Action!

	Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:

<b>	BANG!
</b>
	Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings
	his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. 
	Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
	escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He
	swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are
	screaming.  It's CHAOS.

	Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. 
	He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
	her head.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Drop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back
		away from me!

	We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

	The captain is screaming at all his men.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do
		not fire!  No officer will fire his
		weapon unless I say so!
			(to Emil)
		Let the woman go!

	Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still
	aiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't
	lowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.

<b>				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
</b>		Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That
		is an order!  No officers will fire!

	Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
	Emil.

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Tell him to put his gun down!

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Let her go!  Let her go!!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
		kill her.

	Jordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The
	reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
	their lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! 
	Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Let her go.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Shoot!  Shoot him!!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Shut up!

	Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer
		will follow.  No officer will shoot!

	Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

<b>				EMIL
</b>		Shut up!

	Everyone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain
	is trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with
	their weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still
	pointed at Emil. 
	Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's
	pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to
	get the best coverage.

<b>				EMIL (CONT'D)
</b>		I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
		lowers his gun.

	He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
	towards the police boat.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Don't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot
		him!

	Jordy won't take his gun off him.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		Let her go.  Let her go.

	The captain is yelling at Jordy.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower
		your weapon!

	Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His
	heart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his
	weapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil
	laughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his
	weapon.

<b>	JORDY SHOOTS
</b>
	Emil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the
	handcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
	he shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the
	shoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
	chest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
	Emil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the
	ground.  Dead.  The captain yells.

<b>				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
</b>		I told you not to shoot!  No officers
		should shoot.

	Jordy quietly answers:

<b>				JORDY
</b>		I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.

<b>				HAWKINS
</b>		He's still alive.

	Hawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. 
	His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.

<b>	OLEG'S VIDEO POV
</b>
	as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He
	looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:

<b>				OLEG
</b>		A film...by Oleg Razgul.

	And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins
	jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.

<b>				OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>		How was that?

	Oleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs
	over to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad
	Emil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Wait a minute.  Where are you going? 
		Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of
		public opinion.  Take the credit, you
		need it.

	She turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push
	the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.

<b>				JORDY
</b>		No thanks.

	Jordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's
	EDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. 
	She looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens
	pointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. 
	He doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want
	the fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because
	he was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.

<b>				NICOLETTE
</b>		Cut.

	Her cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. 
	Jordy turns and walks away.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to
		me.

	Jordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS
	back to Nicolette.

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you
		saw it.

	The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is
	now on:

<b>	THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE
</b>
	We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her
	stand up:

<b>				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>		New York City has a new hero, Fire
		Marshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire
		Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this
		afternoon will help with his other legal
		problems.  WB11 has also learned that
		the fire Marshal has retained an
		immigration lawyer to help Daphne
		Handlova with her case.  We wish her
		well.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at
		Battery Park, WB11 New York.  Good
		night.

          We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some

          An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
          It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
          bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the

          We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-
          ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel
          cranks right as the car turns onto a -
                         
          One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang
          hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -
                         
          Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing
          the trash aside. The car whips another turn and

          The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front
          door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.

          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some
          cash. Will snatches it and heads off.

          The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops
          before getting into his ride.

          The sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class
          town in suburban Maryland.
                         
          A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.
                         
          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in
          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her
          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.
                         
          Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap.

          Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His
          balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's
          worth of pizza grease.

<b>          EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
          Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in

</b>           When my dad got outta the service, he
           started buying lotto tickets. He'd
           play his dog tag numbers. In '91,
           the fucker won five million bucks.

</b>           He had some health problems a few
           years back, and since then he's been
           burning through the money like an
           NBA draft pick. Probably only got a
           million or two left. But it's mine
           as soon as he kicks.
          Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow,
          mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly.

</b>           You know, with a million bucks, you
           could have anything. Be like a king.
           (almost a moan)
           King Dwayne.

</b>           That's right. And maybe I'll make
           you my queen. Let you polish my
           royal scepter.

</b>           Practice makes perfect.
          Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed
          out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet.
<b>                          JUICY
</b>           Let me ask you a question...do you
           really hate your daddy?
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           Hate him like the Steelers.
<b>                          JUICY
</b>           Then maybe I can help you get that
           money now. Before he spends another
           penny.
                         
          Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts,
          emboldening him.

          Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear -
                         
<b>                          JUICY

          On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his
          mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.

          KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She

           about how your mom fucked that
           lifeguard. And I always felt awful
           about it, because even though he
           swore secrecy, he told everyone else
           in town. And then your parents wound
           up getting divorced. But now...I
           don't give a shit.

          Will takes a swing at Chet. He dodges it and puts Will in
          some sort of choke hold.

          A day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven
          mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh
          and joke around. Best buds.
                         
          Will looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks
          it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then
          grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them
          to sop it up.

          Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him.

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway.
          The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into
          the distance.
                         
<b>          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown
          shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that
          Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the
          sky, beacon light flashing atop it.
                         
          Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.
                         
<b>          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
</b>                         
          The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.
                         
          There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio
          tower built on top of a small office structure.
<b>           27.

          The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.

          This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he
          gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne

          To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.

          Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in
          no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.

          Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.

</b>           Fuck! Get him!
                         
          Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay
          picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
                         
          Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps
          on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.

          Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked
          rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.
          Will soon goes limp.
                         
          Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla
          mask back and smiles.

          Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous
          now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at
          his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his
          back. He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive
          green Army jacket.

          Will mumbles something through the duct tape.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

          Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get
          his hands loose so he can tear it open.

          down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.

          Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,
          wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but
          intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored
          wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital
          display and a keypad.

          bites his lip, weighing the situation...

           but you know what the problem is...I'm
           a better man than you. And someday,
           I might actually forgive you. So if
           I let you blow up, or whatever, that
           shit might come back and eat at my
           conscience, and totally affect my
           relationships with other people.
           Like my wife and kids and shit.

           blow at any second?
                         
          Will just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance.
          After a beat -

          Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet.

          Will walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his
          shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him.

           On Tuesday, which today is. You hit
           a slick patch, trip and fall, and I
           got a classroom full of kids wearing
           their skin inside out.

           And there are metal lockers on either

          bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.
                         
          Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats
          bullets, gives Will a look of death.

</b>           I've been thinking about it, and I
           want you to start off working the
           counter. Sounds like a demotion, I
           know, but it's an important position.
           Because we're gonna be using code
           words and shit. For example, if a
           customer walks in and says he wants a
           tan, that just means he wants a tan.
           But if he says he wants a "deluxe
           tan," that means a blow job and you
           gotta get one of the girls in there

          Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking

          laugh or remotely smile at any of it.

</b>           Damn. Maybe we should just wait
           around for the money shot.
                         
          The guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           That the money?
                         
<b>                          WILL
</b>           Maybe. Where's the girl?
                         
          Dwayne grins.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           In the van. Maybe.
                         
<b>                          WILL
</b>           Get her out here. You're wasting time.
                         
          Will grips the bag close to him.
                         
          Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.
          Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.
          A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-
          like device in his hand.
                         
          Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.
          They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.
                         
<b>                          KATE

</b>           I'm here. It's gonna be okay.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

<b>                          WILL
</b>           Just let her come over here.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           I will. But you should know, my
           associate over there is packing a
           flamethrower.
                         
          Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a
          button and a pilot light comes on.

           Or a bullet.
                         
          Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
          forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes
          her behind him.

          Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.

          Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at
          the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the
          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.
          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
                         
          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.

<b>                          WILL
</b>           I figured as much. That's why I got

          Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
          shining in his eyes.

          Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
          dot that dances on his forehead.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

          In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his
          laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.
                         
          Will grins at Dwayne.

           can't guarantee he'll get both of
           you. But he'll definitely get you.
                         
          As Will turns away -

</b>           Hold the fuck up.
                         
          Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.
                         
<b>                          VAUGHN
</b>           Wasn't expecting to see you here.
                         
          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
          butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn
          points the gun at her and she shuts up.
                         
          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

</b>           Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the
           money over here.
                         
          Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
          gun at him.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

          Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
                         
          Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
                         
<b>                          VAUGHN

<b>                          VAUGHN
</b>           I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the
           two loose ends in the gorilla masks.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           I'm not a loose end!
                         
<b>                          VAUGHN
</b>           You're a fucking idiot. You are as
           loose as ends get.
                         
          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.
          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.
<b>           101.

<b>                          VAUGHN
</b>           What the -
                         
          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more
          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
          ball of fire at him.
                         
          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of
<b>                         WHICH -
</b>                         
          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
          knocking him off his feet.
                         
          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the
          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's
          shoulder and she whirls around to find -
                         
<b>                          KATE

<b>                          CHET
</b>           Not now. We gotta take off.
<b>                          (LOOKS AROUND)
</b>           Where's Will?
                         
          Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
                         
          Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
                         
          Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it
          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,
          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to
          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,
          a bullet, would cause
                         
<b>          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES
</b>                         
          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the
          garbage bag.
                         
<b>                          WILL

          They take off toward Will's car.
                         
          Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The
          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-
          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
                         
          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
          that it's out of bullets.
                         
          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.
<b>           102.
</b>                         
          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.
                         
          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks
          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he
          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,
          frantically looks around. The money is gone.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           No!!
                         
          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of
          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,
          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
                         
<b>                          JAY
</b>           Dwayne! Help!
                         
          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's
          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           Goddamn it, Jay!
                         
          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it
          to beat the flames down.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE
</b>           Stop, drop and roll!
                         
          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,
          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
          smothers the last of them out.
                         
          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
                         
<b>                          JAY

</b>           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.

          Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

          Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate
          opens the door, steps out onto the porch.
                         
          Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns.

          Chet smiles, shakes his head as -
                         
          Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves
          clock overtime.
                         
<b>                          WILL

          A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the
          furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find -
                         
          A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne's voice booms and

          The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From
          the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:
                         
<b>                          MAJOR TAN
</b>                         
          A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT
          unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall
          storefront. We are watching a local commercial with
          appropriately poor production value.

          Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera
          and trying not to trip -

           ensure a cutting-edge tanning
           experience.
                         
          Dwayne enters a tanning room. A man in a lab coat stares
          down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific
          equation is written.

          The man turns: it's Jay. His smiling face is speckled with
          healing burn wounds.

           word for it. The proof...
                         
          Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him
          disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.
                         
<b>                          DWAYNE

          We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway.

</b>           But Major Tan isn't just about looking
           good. It's also about feeling good.
                         
          Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy
          saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits.

          about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But
          he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
                         
          A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!

</b>    The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of
    heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates
    ACROSS the SCREEN.

</b>    The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-
    ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He
    looks to the rear.
<b>                             FOUCHET
</b>               What's taking so long back there?

</b>    Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,
    and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except
    for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.
    His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-
    along grin on his face.
<b>                             ANDY
</b>               How do I look? Like the real
               thing, yeah?
<b>                             FOUCHET

               look at you.


<b>    CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR
</b>    THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps
    further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the
    front.

</b>               Tell me again about your

    Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

     turns a corner.

</b>     He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds
     distressed.
<b>                            FOUCHET

     on full.

</b>     Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people
     walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from
     nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the
     hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:

</b>     Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster
     their guns. The posing is over. This is business.

</b>     On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One
     containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next
     to each.

     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across
     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out
     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.
     Then --
     BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through.
     Burnett on backup.

</b>              Police!   On the floor!
     But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One
     goes left and the other, right.

</b>     Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA
     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,
     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw
     and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs
     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

</b>     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.
     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs
     of a chair.
<b>                              BURNETT
</b>                Lowrey!
     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles.
     Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just
     in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for
     him.

<b>A9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9
</b>     Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the
     balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some
     occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops
     move in   to assist.

</b>     Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the
     bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a
     yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched
     lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and
     it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over

     As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very
     groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a

     to Ice-T's "COP KILLER." They get a kick out of the

              Miami's the perfect town for you,
              Burnett. You drive like a one-
              hundred-seven-year-old lady with

     An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling
     an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it.

</b>              I don't have a death wish like
              you. I  got a family that counts
              on me.  A mortgage to pay. And
              I'm not sayin' it's me, but most
              of the guys in the station think
              you're some rich kid playin' cop.
<b>                            LOWREY
</b>              Who said that?

     Burnett mumbles an answer.
<b>                            LOWREY
</b>              If somebody's talking about me, I
              wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of
              this. I don't apologize for
              nothing I do. I get up early and
              take it to the max every day. I'm
              always the first guy through the
              door. And the last guy to leave a
              crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I

     Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to

     Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body.
     He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis-
     stiffened knee is in the   way. So Lowrey gives it a shove
     and the chair swivels.    Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp
     off the desk.

</b>     Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by
     Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist.
     Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
<b>                             EDDIE
</b>               Max, my little carina. It's
               been a long time. And who's
               your friend?
<b>                              MAX
</b>               Eddie.   Julie.

     Julie sizes him up.    Good taste.   His suit.   Bad taste.
     His personality.
<b>                             EDDIE
</b>               Come on, Julie. Come in, Max.
               Welcome to the Al Capone suite.
     Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite. High
     arched ceilings. Magnificent antique furniture. Killer
     view. No party guests.
<b>                             EDDIE
</b>               I'm not kidding. Capone had
               the place fixed up with secret
               passages and hidden stairways.
               Can you dig it? People were
               actually killed within these
               walls.
     He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase
     that rises into darkness.


<b>     CLOSE ON JULIE
</b>     Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface
     wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
<b>                              JULIE
</b>               Excuse me?   I need to use the
               bathroom.
     Julie crosses to the bathroom.
<b>                             EDDIE
</b>               Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped
               off the edge of the earth and died.
               Either that or you moved to
               California.

     From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of
     heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just
     hit paydirt on the very first try.

     this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside
     the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the

     Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She
     does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of
     the rear when --

     Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE.

     way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off
     the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he
     approaches.

<b>     CLOSE ON DOORKNOB
</b>     As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls
     open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his
     face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.

     Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the
     room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door.

<b>     FOUCHET
</b>     Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are
     catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the

     stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...

     leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears.
     Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies
     by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie
     sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof.
     Turns to see --

<b>69   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    69
</b>     Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans
     the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away --
     and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.

     leaps from the roof. SLOW-MOTION as Julie flies through
     the air like some glamorous angel.

     red and blue lights. CAMERA PANS PAST the crime scene
     personnel to find Burnett and Lowrey pulling up to the

</b>     Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel. Lowrey's quick
     to note the two separate shades of lipstick.

      Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the
      towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his
      eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself
      facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny
      surface.   Shit.

               was looking for the heroin that
               Eddie stole from him... Max went
               to the party as a favor to you.
               You're a dope cop, right?

      Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her
      wet hair, wearing nothing but what she   described, a T-
      shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe
      string. This ensemble never looked so    good.

      Lowrey. All ego.

      Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds
      the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty
      frame, too.

      on the door.

      Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,
      it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and
      the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From
      around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and
      Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as
      a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at
      the deck.
      The door swings open.
      Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

      deadly until Julie breaks the silence.

      But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their
      rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror.
      He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and
      TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the

<b>                             LOWREY

                      (rolls up the window)

               see 'em. Feet spread.
      Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett
      respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out
      and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking
      Burnett's shoulders.

               start at the waistband. See if
               he's carrying a piece.
      Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to
      Burnett's waistband where he feels a --

               involving two Miami P.D. officers
               remains unexplained by department
               spokesmen. This high-speed chase
               was captured two nights ago by

               while the driver was killed, both
               police officers involved in the
               incident seemed to escape without

      and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
      the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
      He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
      dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
      Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

      stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
      onto the pavement.

      gives way.

      pallets full of  dope.

      With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and
      Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop
      from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city
      amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They
      wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting
      forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and
      dumped into the truck.

      if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right     for
      the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving    and
      spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing

</b></pre><pre>Alien Resurrection 



<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.
</b>
We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

<b>INT.  AURIGA
</b>
along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

<b>INT.  MEDLAB
</b>
Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel. 

Tubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine.

As we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can 
see what might even be a face.

Eyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming.

<b>ANGLE: WHEAT.
</b>
A birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen.  
Sharp contrast to what we have seen before.

There is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven 
or eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair.

<b>GIRL'S VOICE
</b>
My mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there 
are.

The girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her 
chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see.

She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty 
yards away.

The girl's expression becomes perplexed.

She slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, 
wriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more 
distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout.

The sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another.  
She looks down in  growing horror and sees:

Blood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, 
a sea of blood now, dark, thick.

The girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely 
covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she 
finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  LAB
</b>
Instruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure.

Scientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic.

We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the 
size of a man, and in a new case.

The camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a 
second one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. HALLLWAY
</b>
Tiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning 
into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving 
until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of 
dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us...

ANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream 
it keeps shifting.

She opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless.

She reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard.

Tearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  OPERATING CHAMBER
</b>
And the cause of this dream becomes apparant:

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST
</b>
being cut open with a lasersaw.

We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it.  
And her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her 
face her identity is unmistakable.

Around her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a 
young and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands 
a bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN.

<b>WREN
</b>
Careful ... ready with the amnio...

Gediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it.  
Pulls apart the chest.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
There she is...

He says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a 
sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at 
severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Here we go.

He holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator 
filled with  amniotic fluid.

The alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of 
his grasp.

<b>WREN
</b>
Watch it!

Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from 
him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the 
top rapidly.

Everybody looks at each other for a moment.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Well ...

<b>WREN
</b>
The host?

A surgeon looks at Ripley's readings.

<b>SURGEON
</b>
Doing fine.

Gediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods.

<b>WREN
</b>
Sew her back up.

Gediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the 
alien.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Well, that went as well as could be expected--

Ripley's hand LASHES OUT, GRABS the surgeon's forearm.  He yells in 
pain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things 
over and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING.

<b>SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. RIPLEY'S CELL
</b>
Sudden stillness.

Ripley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber.  She's wide 
eyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia. Hair tangled 
and wild. But at least she's not so  blue as before.

The only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of 
glass in the center of the ceiling.

<b>ANGLE: ABOVE THE CELL
</b>
A guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the 
square of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley.

(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells 
below.)

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
She is still for a long while.  Then she lifts her hands, looking at 
them.

Touches her face, her skin.

She fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck.  There is a scar running 
along her chest.

She fingers it thoughtfully. -

She looks at her forearm.  Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the 
number 8.

She looks up, her face unreadable.

<b>CUT TO':
</b>
<b>INT.  LAB
</b>
Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her.

He deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes.

Wren enters, looking at a chart.

<b>WREN
</b>
How's our number Eight today?

<b>GEDIMAN:
</b>
Appears to be in good health...

<b>WREN
</b>
(noticing his tone)

How good?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Extraordinary. As in, completely off our projected charts.

(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue.  See the recession?

<b>WREN
</b>
This is from --

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Yesterday!

<b>WREN
</b>
This is good.  This is very good.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
I'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination...  We're not 
looking at a normal cloning arc.

<b>WREN:
</b>
Approved.

Wren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction.

<b>WREN
</b>
Well, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud.

She grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as 
she  brings his face to hers.  Her eyes are burn but lost.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Why?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Oh my God...

He is as wide eyed as WREN, and he isn't having his windpipe crushed.

After a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the 
alarm.

Klaxons, red light fire up.

A guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley.  After a moment of 
staring him down, she opens her hand.  Wren falls to his knees gasping.

The guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes 
out and sends her flying back into the corner.

<b>WREN
</b>
No! No! I'm all right!

The guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are 
called -- leveled  at Ripley. She has recovered from the shock quickly, 
sits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular.

RIPLEY (wearily)

Why...?

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
Wren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests 
Ripley.

With them is General PEREZ, the man in charge this boat. Ramrod 
straight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley 
suspiciously.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
The scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, 
boat.

Ripley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed 
off and bored.

<b>WREN
</b>
It's unprecedented.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Totally!  She's operating at a completely adult capacity.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
And her memories?

<b>WREN
</b>
There are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
She's freaked.

Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance.

<b>WREN
</b>
"It" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional 
autism.

Certain reactions....

Perez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall.

<b>TO:
</b>
<b>INT HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second 
observation room.

<b>GEDIMAN:
</b>
But the thing is, we can't terminate her. It.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
You haven't told me what you think has caused this.

Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought 
to adult term.  I'm right?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
There's been cases..

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Not like this.

<b>WREN
</b>
Well, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a 
collective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like 
instinct, only  more complex structurally.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
In some cases. You're talking about the alien.

<b>WREN
</b>
Yes.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
You promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing.

<b>WREN
</b>
It's not like the other ones..

Perez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second 
observation room door opens..	

He steps in, the other two right behind him.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO
</b>
Darker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards 
by the door.

Apart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
But there is some genetic mix.

<b>WREN
</b>
Yes.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Will there be further mutation?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Mutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.

<b>WREN
</b>
That's one of the things we need to study.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
All right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for 
God's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises.

And as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the 
ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at 
the back of his head.

The reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, 
stops it.

As it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the 
alien's face.

Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.

Perez turns to look at it with the others.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
It took a hell of a lot to get us here.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
No shit.

Wren shoots him another look.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
How soon before this one's ovulating?

<b>WREN
</b>
Days.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Is that normal?

<b>WREN
</b>
No way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated.

(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
They're coming.  Soon.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MESS HALL
</b>
Ripley sits across from Gediman. He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, 
however, has stopped.  She is staring at her fork, her brows furrowed.  
Turns it over in her hand, in her mind.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
"Fork."

The memory comes, and she shakes her head wearily.

RIPLEY (softly)

Fuck....

GEDIMAN (pretending to correct her)

"Fork."

Ever so slightly, she smiles. The smile fades, and after a moment:

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
How did you...

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
How did we get you?  Blood samples from Fiori 16. On ice. 

Do you remember that place?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Does it grow?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Does it.....Yeah. Rapidly.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It's a queen.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
How did you know that?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It'll breed.  You'll die.  Everyone in the ... fucking.... (searches 
for the word, then spits it out) ... Company.  Will die.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Company?

<b>WREN (O.S.)
</b>
Weyland Yutani.

He has entered behind her, comes up to the table.

<b>WREN
</b>
Our Ripley's former employers.  Terran Growth conglom, had some defense 
contracts  under the military. Before your time, Gediman -- they went 
under decades ago, bought out by Walmart.  Fortunes of war.

(to Ripley)

You'll find things have changed a good deal since your time.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
1 doubt that.

<b>WREN
</b>
We're not flying blind here, you know.  This is United Systems 
military, not some greedy corporation. The potential benefits of this 
race go way beyond urban pacification.

New alloys, new vaccines ... there's nothing like this in any world 
we've seen.  

You should be very proud.

She laughs, bitterly.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Oh, I am.

<b>WREN
</b>
And the animal itself is wonderous. They'll be invaluable once we've 
harnessed them.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It's a cancer.  You can't teach it tricks.

This stops Wren, and he retreats silently.  Ripley repeats word to 
herself, thinking.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
"Them" ...

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  HALL   CONTINUOUS
</b>
As Wren is leaving the mess, he is accosted by an ensign.

<b>ENSIGN
</b>
Doctor, General Perez is asking for you. We've been hailed.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE
</b>
We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME, 
heading for it.  

A small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is 
pristine.  

To accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is 
accompanied by 

<b>HEAVY, THRASHING ROCK MUSIC.
</b>
<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  COCKPIT    CONTINUOUS
</b>
The music is coming from nearby.  Piloting the ship toward the Auriga 
is HILLARD, a roughskinned woman in her forties, along with RANE, a 
slight and quiet fellow.

Behind them stands ELGYN, the leader of the group.

Has the kind of authority that doesn't need to flaunt itself.

Maybe fifty, by the silver in his hair. He speaks into the vidcom

<b>ELGYN
</b>
(good naturedly)

My authorization code is 'fuck you', son.  Now open the goddamn bay or 
General Perez  is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass.

He switches off.

<b>RANE
</b>
Wichita stomp?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
I guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman.

(to Hillard)

Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Darlin', it's done.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Don't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright.

He puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he 
exits.

They're more than friends.

He moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Christie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking.

He proceeds into:

<b>INT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most 
of the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly 
the size of winnebagos.

As Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of 
them.

She's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth 
and prettiness.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Call!  CALL!

The music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner.  

Elgyn switches it off.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Call!

<b>CALL
</b>
What?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
We're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured?

<b>CALL
</b>
I checked 'em an hour ago.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
I don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your 
hide.

<b>CALL
</b>
Trust me, boss.

ELGYN (laughs)

Not my style.

He leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel 
dolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late 
forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
How's it looking?

VRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a 
total fucking write-off.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
You'll make it good.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Don't be so sure.

(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs!

ELGYN (straightening up)

They just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far.

He exits.

<b>CUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS
</b>
CHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has 
distinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me 
authority.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
What's our status?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
We're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Oh great.  Army food..

ST JUST ("San-Jhoost") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool.  

Moves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is 
strapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer 
holder, but a very complex one.

ELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get 
those harvesters on their feet.

This'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are 
friendly.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
We expecting any trouble?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
From Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CARGO BAY     CONTNIUOUS
</b>
ANGLE: VRIESS working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the 
thresher inches above his head.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
I'm patched in. Check the sequence timer.

(no answer)

Call?

<b>ANGLE: THE CONTROLS
</b>
A hand reaches in toward the ON switch.

<b>ANGLE: VRIESS
</b>
<b>VRIESS
</b>
Call?

The thresher GRINDS TO LIFE -- a hundred blades and claws spinning at 
Vriess's head!

Vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Goddamnit!

The second he's out he hits a lever and the back of the dolly flies up, 
transforming it-into a wheelchair.

VRIESS  Johner! You son of a whore!

JOHNER jumps down from the machine, laughing.  He's thickset, mean and 
ugly, with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head.

Thought I'd give you a little haircut there.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
You fuck!

Call, who has been over on the other side of the thresher, ably climbs 
up on it  and switches it off.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
You should see your face. Vriess, you must have soiled yourself.

VRIESS One of these days I'm gonna kill you. My hand to God.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Well, you already gave him your feet ...

CALL (jumping down)

You're a limp fucking scrotum, you know that?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Either of you want a piece of me, I'm less than busy.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Any time.

<b>CALL
</b>
Vriess. Forget it. He's been sucking down too much homebrew.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Don't push me, little Annalee.  You hang with us a while, you'll learn 
I'm not the man with whom to fuck.

He exits, full of annoying bravado.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
That inbred cocksucker.

He feels his forehead, comes up with a bit of blood.  Realizes how 
close it was ...

Call looks up at the thresher.

<b>CALL
</b>
1 hate machines.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Well, now we know it works ...

<b>CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA DOCKING BAY
</b>
As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship.  The bay on the 
bottom of the Auriga 

- the doors are actually OVER the ship, which rises into the airlock.

<b>INT.  AIR LOCK
</b>
The outer doors close under the ship.  Pressurized air shoot into the 
airlock for a few seconds, and then the inner door opens. the ship 
rising into the bay.

<b>INT.  BAY
</b>
The ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end.  
The top of  the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs 
the length of the bay.

Three soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform. The hatch 
atop the ship slowly  opens. One by one the crew files out. Seeing them 
en masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this 
Environment.  They're not wearing uniforms.  They're an  eclectic, 
fiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color 
showing  through militarian space gear.  Johner's bright tuorquise 
bowling shirt.  Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters.  Even 
Vriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform.

What they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery 
skin.  The cool readiness to kill.  These guys are smugglers.  A long 
while ago, you'd have called them pirates

All eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them.  They file 
past the silent, uniformed soldiers.  The last one suddenly puts a hand 
on Johner's jacket, stops him.

There is a bulge under it.  A green sensor light on the back of the 
soldier's glove turns  red when he touches the bulge.

<b>SOLDIER
</b>
No projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel, sir.

Johner opens his jacket, shows what he's packing: a large thermos.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Moonshine. My own. Much more dangerous.

<b>SOLDIER
</b>
Sorry, sir.

ELGYN (to Perez)

What, do you think we're going to hijack the vessel?  All eight of us?

No, I think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a 
bullet through  the hull. we are in space, Elgyn.

He enters from the antechamber, motions for the crew to follow him. 

Vriess comes abreast of the soldier.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Wanna check the chair?

The soldier makes no response, simply falls in behind Call, the last of 
them.

<b>CUT TO:  INT.  ANTECHAMBER
</b>
The long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship.  The group 
proceeds down it, the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
This place is really clean.

JOHNER (to a guard)

Hey.  You got any whores on this vessel?

(the guard remains stonefaced)

Any loose women with bad eyesight?

<b>PEREZ
</b>
I think you'll find our accomodations somewhat spartan.  Although the 
cook sets a good-table.

JOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for.

VRIESS (to Call)

What's the matter?

She is looking around her, somewhat tensely.

<b>CALL
</b>
I don't like army.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Yeah, join the fucking club.

<b>CUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY
</b>
A stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, 
and identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail 
napkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills.

<b>WIDER ANGLE: INT.  PEREZIS CHAMBERS    LATER
</b>
A good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is 
behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
This wasn't easy to come by.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Neither was our cargo. You're not pleading poverty, are you?

<b>PEREZ
</b>
We're well funded. I mean the bills. There's not many that still deal 
in coin.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Just the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded. The 
fringe element.

I guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it?

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Drink?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Constantly.  I'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly 
approved by congress.

Perez pours two whiskeys.

PEREZ (changing the subject)

So where do you go from here?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Out by the Handle.  We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em 
on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Call.  Where'd you find her?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
She is severely fuckable, isn't she? - And the very devil with a socket 
wrench.

I think Vriess somewhat pines.

He takes a stack of bill, smells it.  He likes the smell.-

<b>ELGYN
</b>
She is curious about this little transaction.  You can hardly blame 
her, Awfully cloak and  dagger...

Perez hands a drink to ELGYN.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
This is an army operation.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Most army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space.

And they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Do you want something, Elgyn?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Just bed and board, couple of days worth.  If we're not imposing.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Not at all. Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, 
and mi casa is yours too.

Elgyn drinks to that.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
I trust, of course, that you can mind your own business.

ELGYN (smiles)

I'm famous for it.

They drink. 

<b>CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA
</b>
The 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is 
wheeled into:

<b>INT.  A CHAMBER
</b>
Where Wren and a few others are waiting.  Gediman looks a little 
nervous, not sure this is a good idea.

The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the 
electric lock.

It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel.

They are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes. 
People sleeping inside.

One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second 
unit is wheeled in.

By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in 
the dark chamber.

The scientists meanwhile retire to INT.  AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a 
long glass window looking at the chamber.

The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock 
behind them.

Wren starts pushing buttons.

The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open.  We see temperature and 
lifesign gauges begin to change..

There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes 
lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly.

Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs.  The ceiling rotates 
just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers.

For a moment nothing happens.

One of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly. Opens. All ten eggs open 
simultaneously.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CONFERENCE HALL
</b>
A huge room, used for assemblies and events. It has a chain basketball 
net set up at one end, crude court lines taped to the floor.  Ripley 
stands beneath the net with a ball, dribbling absently.

At the other end are set up tables and folding chairs.  The crew of the 
Betty, sans Elgyn, are filing in to eat here.  Johner spies Ripley, 
smiles.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Ooh.

Johner comes up to Ripley.  Her expression makes it clear how much she 
enjoys having him in her face.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
How about a little one on one?

She keeps dribbling, says nothing.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
What do you say?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Get away from me.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Why should I?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Because pain hurts.

He falters a moment at her quiet threat, then:

JOHNER Are you gonna hurt me then? 1 think I might enjoy that.

He smiles his ugly smile. She smiles back.

She hits, him solidly in the chest -- and he flies back ten feet, 
landing badly on a group of chairs.

His mates fly into action, Christie grabs a standing ashtray. Hillard 
jumps Ripley from behind.   She throws her off with e -- chucks the 
basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it.

Christie swings at her and SMASHES her right in the face.

She arcs back... and right back up, at Christie's throat before he has 
a chance to react, squeezing, batting away the ashtray just a trickle 
of blood coming down her nose --

Johner cames at her again and she leaps on him, throws him to the 
ground, snarling,

<b>SHE'S GONNA RIP HIS THROAT OUT WITH HER TEETH.
</b>
<b>WREN
</b>
Ripley.

Ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her.  Wren and 
Gediman behind them.

Call, standing to one side with Vriess, reacts visibly to the name.  
Everybody is slowly backing off.  St Just stands with his hands behind 
his back, as if concealing something.

Call watches in rapt silence.

<b>WREN
</b>
Don't let's have a scene.

Ripley lets go of Johner, stands.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
He... smells

<b>WREN
</b>
I imagine he does.

JOHNER (barely breathing)

What the fuck are you?

She looks down on him - in both senses of the phrase. - Look around at 
everyone staring at her.

She wipes the bit of blood from under her nose, flicks it away. Exits.

WREN (to Gediman, amused)

Social skills, less than a hundred' percent.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S BLOOD
</b>
The few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor -- not eating 
through, but melting  a small patch.

<b>TO: INT.  LABS - LATER
</b>
A large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen. Soldiers 
surround it, weapons at the ready.  Not one of them at ease.

Wren and Gediman watch intently.

<b>WREN
</b>
What's the status on the Queen?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
We still haven't detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies. But 
the egg laying  stage appears to be over.

<b>WREN
</b>
Did we do something wrong?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
I don't know. I think we covered everything. But these redundancies...

A soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open 
automatically.

Everyone waits.

A fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen. The soldier shut it as 
quickly as humanly possible.

<b>WREN
</b>
Father, check security status, observation pen six.

Father, the voice of the ship, replies after a moment in a dulcet, 
comforting tone.

<b>FATHER
</b>
Pen six secure, security systems functional at 100%.

<b>WREN
</b>
Good.  Now the others.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  SLEEP CHAMBERS - NIGHT
</b>
We see VARIOUS ANGLES of people at night:

Rane, in, a chamber on the Auriga.

Hillard and Elgyn, in a slightly more lush one.

Perez, in his quarters.

VRIESS, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over.

Christie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall.

<b>CUT TO:  INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT
</b>
A sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near 
emptiness of the room.

Gediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he 
watches the pen.

Inside are three aliens. Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up 
in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and 
hissing at it. 

Gediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the 
beast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue 
issues slowly forth, dripping with slime.

GEDIMAN (softly, fascinated)

Is that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see 
me?

The creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes.

Something moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand 
closes on his shoulder.

It's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems 
only mildly surprised.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
How did you get in here?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Beautiful, aren't they?

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Yes.  Yes they are.  I've been monitoring their interaction.

He points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the 
vibrating line, indicating sound.

He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
They communicate.  Through ultrasonic soundwaves.  Sort of like bats.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I know.

She looks at him.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I can hear them.

GEDIMAN (smiling)

Amazing ...

She runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up 
off his chair.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Ripley...

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Shhhhh.

She pulls him close, kisses him.  Lightly at first, then deeply - 
holding his head with both hands. He responds with surprising warmth, 
the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart.

She looks at him, smiles.

An alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth, burying itself in his face.

<b>SMASH CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CHAMBER
</b>
As she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard.

She has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: 
squatting in the middle of the room. She looks about her, recovering 
from the nightmare... Her breathing slows. With a somewhat fatalistic 
look, she settles back to sleep.

<b>CUT TO: INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Christie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker 
game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table.

They are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
I'm in.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
All right.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Raise you two hundred.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Oh, fuck you!

<b>CALL
</b>
That's it. I'm out. I'm fucked.

She throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine. 
It tastes horrible.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
That takes me down, too. Johner?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Uh, Uh, fuck it. I fold.

(to St Just)

What do-you got?

St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
You'll always wonder.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
You asshole.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Johner, your deal.

<b>CALL
</b>
Deal me out. It's not my night.

She tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair.  The others laugh.

<b>CALL
</b>
Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Just for coloring.

ST JUST (producing a small vial)

I got something that'll take the edge off that.

CALL  Thanks, I'll walk it off.

She stumbles out of the room.  Johner shuffles the deck.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Bitches should not play with the boys, they will get cleaned out.

(dealing)

Eight card throwback, fuck your sister and the sevens are wild.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  HALL
</b>
As soon as she is out of sight, Call straightens up, completely sober.  
She looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas.

She comes to the door and making sure no one is around, star punching 
in code on the keypad.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CELLBLOCK - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
As Call pads silently down it, looking for one cell.

<b>TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The cell door opens silently.  Call hesitates a moment, then slips in, 
shutting the door behind her.

Ripley is sleeping, still in the squatting position in the middle of 
the room. 

Call approaches.

She stares down at Ripley a moment.  A shadow passes as a guard walks 
above them,

Call tenses till he is gone.  Look's back down at Ripley -- still 
sleeping.

Call extends her hand, flexes her wrist.  The meanest lookin stilletto 
you've ever seen extends from out her sleeve. it, gotta be a foot long, 
and sharp enough to shave with.

She lifts back her arm, the better to punch it through Ripley's heart.

Ripley shifts slightly.  Call stops.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST
</b>
Her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar. Call 
hesitates, staring, realization flooding her face.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Well?

Call starts, moving back a pace.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You gonna kill me or what?

<b>CALL
</b>
There's no point, is there?

A flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve.  
Ripley sits up.

<b>CALL
</b>
It's already out of you.  Christ... Is it here?  Is it on board?

RIPLEY (smiling)

You mean my baby?  CALL

I don't understand.  If they've got it, why are they keeping you alive?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Curious.  I'm the latest thing...

<b>CALL
</b>
Those sick fucks.

She raises her arm, the stilletto gliding out again.

<b>CALL
</b>
I can make it stop.  The pain... this nightmare.. That's all I can 
offer you.

Ripley holds her palm up, presses it against the point of the blade.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
What makes you think I would let you do that?

Ripley pushes her hand out - the blade goes RIGHT THROUGH HER PALM. She 
keeps pushing her hand out slowly, a good five inches of the blade 
sticking out the back of her hand  before she stops. Call stares at 
her.

<b>CALL
</b>
What are you?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant first class, number 36706.

<b>CALL
</b>
Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago.

Ripley pulls her hand back suddenly, grimacing at the pain.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
What do you know about it?

<b>CALL
</b>
I've read Morse -- I've read all the banned histories.  She gave her 
life to protect us from the beast.  You're not her.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
If I'm not her. What am I?

<b>CALL
</b>
You're a thing.  A construct.  They grew you in a fucking lab.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
But only God can make a tree.

<b>CALL
</b>
And now they've brought the beast out of you.

RIPLEY (smiling)

Not all the way out.

<b>CALL
</b>
What?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It's in my head.  Behind my eyes.  I can hear it moving.  The beast.

The smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through.  Call 
softens, trying a different tack.

<b>CALL
</b>
Help me.  If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them 
before  this thing gets loose.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It's already loose.

Call's expression changes.  Those words terrify her, but she's not sure 
if Ripley means what she thinks.

Ripley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops 
a few inches away.

Then touches her forehead gently, almost sensually.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Once the thought .... the hope for it ... grows here.... it has found 
its way.

It will come, because... man will bring it.  Bring it forth.

<b>CALL
</b>
You want that.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I've come to terms with the fact of it. It's inevitable.

<b>CALL
</b>
Not so long as there's breath-in me.

Ripley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALL'S THROAT.  Call swings wit the blade 
but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect.  Ripley squeezes 
the girls neck.

Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I can... make it ... stop...

Call's eyes are pleading, terrified. Ripley finally lets go and she 
drops to the ground gasping for air.  RIPLEY

Go. They're coming for you.

As soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Call comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head.  
She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them 
and three more.

<b>WREN
</b>
I think you're gonna find that this was ill advised.

(to the men) Where are her friends?

<b>GUARD
</b>
Mess hall, most of them.

<b>WREN
</b>
Sound the alarm. I want them rounded up. Now!

<b>TO: INT.  MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
<b>ANGLE: THE CARD TABLE
</b>
Being kicked over.

Elgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused.

Christie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers.

Call is thrown into the group as well.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
What the fuck is going on here?

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Looks like a doublecross, boss.

<b>WREN
</b>
Where's the other one? With the chair?

JOHNER (to a soldier)

Get your fucking hands off me!

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Do you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to?

<b>WREN
</b>
Shut up! 

(to a guard) Get the general.  Wake him up.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Look, if there's a problem tell me what it is. We can work this out, 
there is no  need to get emotional ...

St Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley 
attacked Johner.

Hands behind his back.

<b>ANGLE: BEHIND ST JUST'S BACK
</b>
As Elgyn speaks, two guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands.

<b>CALL
</b>
They got nothing to do with this, Wren.

ELGYN (to Call)

To do with what?

WREN  I don't give a fuck. It's way too late for that. You're all 
looking at a firing squad.

You hear me?

<b>ELGYN
</b>
I do.  St Just?

With lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the 
guards away.

He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way.

One guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's 
elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat.

Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of 
his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun 
inside. He grabs it and another  guard runs. Johner doesn't have time 
to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it, sending 
the guard flying..

<b>CUT TO: INT.  ALIEN OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Alarms, flashing red lights.  Gediman looking in a video monitor.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
What the fuck... You three!  Go! Sector two.

All but one of the guards rush out to investigate.  Gediman works the 
surveilliance screen, trying to see what's happening

<b>CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
When the smoke clears, There are two guards still standing.  They point 
their weapons inneffectually.  St Just a has gun to wren's head and a 
gun on the guards, who are also covered by Johner.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Nice and easy, boys ...

Call starts to take off.

<b>CALL
</b>
I'm gonna finish this.

Elgyn grabs her by the hair, roughly pulls her back.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
You're going nowhere, Annalee.

<b>CUT TO: INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>ANGLE: IN THE PEN
</b>
The three aliens have picked up the energy. are stalking back and forth 
like tigers in the dim light of their pen.

<b>ANGLE: THEIR POV
</b>
We see Gediman and the guard, their backs to us. The aliens-stop 
pacing.  One of them,  to the right, looks at the one on the left.  
Something passes between them. They look back at the humans.  At each 
other.

They SET ON the middle alien, TEARING IT APART.  It lets out piercing, 
insectile SHRIEKS as they tear it limb from limb.

Gediman spins in terror, the guard bringing up his weapon. Gediman hits 
the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we 
see:

The remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its blood 
<b>EATS A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Oh, God

He bolts for the failsafe but it's too late as the blood eats all the 
way through  - the two aliens DIVE through the hole. just as Gediman 
hits the button -- freezing gas  fills the chamber but there's nothing 
to freeze.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
No no no!

He hits another sequence and the door slides open.  He rushes in, 
kneels by the hole and looks down.

<b>ANGLE: HIS POV
</b>
Their blood has already eaten through two levels.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Christ.  They could be anywhere.

He looks up at the guard -- and an alien FLIES UP at him through the 
hole.  

It was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he 
can breathe a decent scream.

The guard just stares, shaking.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL
</b>
The mexican standoff is getting even more heated.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Who gives a shit!  We have to get out of here.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
If Call's got something going here I want to know what it is!

<b>WREN
</b>
You brought her here..

Two more guards rush in.  Johner shoves' his gun in Wren's mouth.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Drop them!  I'm not fucking with you!

CHRISTIE (indicating the dead soldiers)

Boss, we got bodies here.  It doesn't matter what Call's up to, we're 
all fucked now.

<b>CALL
</b>
I have to stop him.  If I don't we'll all die.

WREN (pulls his mouth away)

Elgyn, tell me what you know. If she's alone in this.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
In what?

Johner puts his gun to Call's temple now.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Does anyone want me to make this simple?

Far away, a SCREAM. Everyone stops.  Wren turns slowly in the direction 
it came from.

<b>WREN
</b>
No...

<b>CUT TO: INT.  HALLWAY BY LABS
</b>
A technican RUNS screaming just as an alien LEAPS on him from behind.  
The CAMERA  RUSHES AWAY, frenzied as the scene, to pick up a guard in 
the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up 
an airvent.  There are three bodies lying dead before us.

<b>ANGLE: IN THE PENS
</b>
We see that the aliens have been freed.  Smoke, dead bodies, the 
plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is cracked and open.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Ripley sits in the dark, the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in.  
And she just can't help herself.

She is LAUGHING.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  PEREZ'S QUARTERS CONTINUOUS
</b>
He is mostly dressed, still shaking off sleep.  He stands at the 
command console, bringing up visual.  Everything on the screens is 
smoke and noise.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Ensign! Damage Report! Ensign!

Nothing.  On one of the screens, an alien is briefly visible. Perez 
stiffens at the sight of it.

He punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded 
lieutenant.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Status!

<b>LIEUTENANT
</b>
Containment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks.

PEREZ (to himself)

A military strike.... Christ Jesus ...

After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their 
sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the 
weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into 
it, falling in a tumble of guns.

Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an 
airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is 
excruciatingly calm:

<b>FATHER
</b>
Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This 
is not a drill.

One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong 
with two of his friends.

They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It 
bounds forward, takes out his face.

<b>FATHER
</b>
Emergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ...

<b>CUT TO..
</b>
<b>INT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning 
voice and the emergency lighting are on.

Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, 
checking out his surroundings.

<b>ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL
</b>
There is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards 
the exit.

Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Nothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, 
carefully.

And was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling.

A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down 
-- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops 
to the floor, eating casually through.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other 
in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying 
the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Bay three!  Go!

The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He 
hits the eject button and steps back.

<b>CUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly 
LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are 
screaming.

Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, 
hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the 
alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. 
The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button.

<b>TO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all 
around the group.

Father's voice still urges evacuaticion

<b>WREN
</b>
<b>NO!
</b>
(to Call)

What have you done?

<b>CALL
</b>
Nothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
All right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk?

He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing.

HILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in 
between?

CALL (indicating Wren)

He does.

One of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano.

DISTEPHANO (to Wren)

Sir, we have to go.

(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
You can have him when we're off. Not before.

They start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the 
soldiers.

What about Vriess?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Fuck Vriess!

<b>CUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Vries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged.

The lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys.

Something stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes.

Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see.

It starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST.

Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly 
compared to the beast.

He turns the corner, spins around.

The hall is fifty feet long.  At the far end a few soldiers running 
through.

<b>SERGEANT
</b>
Seal off that sector!

A soldier runs to obey, working the door controls.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
No!

The soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his-
decision.

Vreiess starts pumping toward the door.  He's strong, picking up speed, 
but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him.

Vriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him.  The door begins 
to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off.

Vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him

An EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily, 
Vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, 
the door closing, too low for him to clear. He gets there and SLAMS a 
lever, his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly  position, his head just 
CLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it, Vriess spinning out 
and flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him.

Lying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the 
door a few more times, then fades off.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Fuck everything....

He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a 
shotgun.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY 5 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Perez is trying to maintain order. He is failing. Grabs a corporal.

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Muster a squad to search for survivors!

<b>CORPORAL
</b>
Fuck no! Fuck no! Fuck you!

Perez slams him to the ground with his fist.

An ALIEN LEAPS OUT at him from the ceiling. The soldiers scatter, Perez 
just leaping out of the way --

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Shoot it! Fry it!

A couple of men fire their burners, to little effect.

One soldier runs up to the action. His head is bloodied, his expression 
vengefully grim.

The soldier whips out a pistol, private.issue, he takes a bead on the 
thing --

<b>PEREZ
</b>
<b>NO!
</b>
And the soldier FIRES -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it 
flying back toward the window.

Perez is riveted by the sight of: ANGLE: DROPS OF BLOOD

big ones, hitting the window. Everything seems to move slowly now - the 
alien,  struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it, the 
other soldiers, Perez -- the monster falls and the BLOOD EATS THROUGH 
<b>THE WINDOW..
</b>
<b>PEREZ
</b>
Get out!  Everyone!  Now!

Soldiers are beginning to get it.. The window CRACKS, begins to SHAKE 
as the blood is almost through it.

Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped, his face frozen in 
horror at what he's about to accomplish.

Perez shoves him, herds the rest out, looking back --

<b>PEREZ
</b>
Clear the sector!

at the window, the blood is almost through --

Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and SLAM 
the door shut  behind them, but most are making for the main exit 
anyway.

<b>FATHER
</b>
Warning.  Potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked 
back against the  window -- he SCREAMS as he is sucked through a hole 
no bigger than his fist.

Still men are falling over each other, Perez herding them out. 

A huge CRACKING sound, and Perez shuts his eyes.

The window explodes outward, the air blowing everything int space. 
Debris, vehicles, men, all tangled and dead as they blown out into the 
black.

<b>ANGLE: THE SECTOR DOORS
</b>
SLAM shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out.

<b>ANGLE: AIR VENTS
</b>
Gates slam down here as well.

<b>ANGLE: ELECTRICAL DUCTS
</b>
Foam SHOOTS into them, hardening instantly, sealing the breached 
sector.

<b>FATHER
</b>
Breach contained. Sector five nonfunctional.

<b>CUT TO: INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
As the crew moves quickly through.  They come to a shut door, red 
lights along it indicating it's locked.

ELGYN (to DiStephano)

Open it.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
I can't.

Johner puts his gun to the soldier's head.

<b>WREN
</b>
He can't!  The sector's closed.  The hull's been breached!

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Okay, which way?

<b>WREN
</b>
We'll have to go through the holding cells.  Here.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
All right.

They turn left, entering

<b>INT.  CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
that leads to the holding cells.  The room is big, a railing at one end 
looking over another chamber two flights down.

A shut door separates the chamber from the cells.

<b>ELGYN
</b>
Can you get that one open?

It comes from the rafters, dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat.  He 
barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back 
of his skull.

Hillard has time.  She SCREAMS as her lover's brains come out his 
mouth.

The beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it 
claws into one of the guards. Everybody else is scrambling for cover.

St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes 
out, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a 
pipe.

Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him. 
Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it.

Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls 
to open the door.

It starts to rise.

<b>CALL
</b>
Christie!  Hillard!  Come on!

The door rises fully.  Ripley stands behind it.

Call starts back, not sure what the woman will do.

Ripley surveys the scene.

The Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops.  
Looks up.

Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other.  ThE alien 
hisses. rears back.

Ripley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her 
face, but her posture passive, sacrificial.  She does not move.

Everyone watches, too afraid to breathe.

The alien LUNGES at her, leaping across the room in two bounds. It's on 
her -- and she SPINS, GPABBING IT, and HURLS IT AWAY.

It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, 
knocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, 
piston tongue at her face, inches away. 

She locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its 
tendons strain, snap.

CALL (to a guard)

Shoot it!  Shoot them both!

She grabs his gun and BURNS them both.  Two less-than-human SCREAMS 
fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart.

The beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley 
again.

Ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with 
inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head.

She dives at it as it comes out from under....

Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's 
momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the 
Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch,

Ripley only slightly better.

A few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down 
the spiral staircase to that level.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Where are you going?

The creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying 
strength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... 
its jaws open, dripping shaking...

The tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT.

A scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she 
SCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE.

She stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near.  
They watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to 
Call.  Ripley looks a tad pissed.

Call tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well.

Ripley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on.

Call looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still 
twitching.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
What the FUCK is going on here?

<b>RANE
</b>
What was that thing?  Are there more of that thing?

JOHNER (to Call)

Make a hell of a necklace...

<b>ANGLE: HILLARD
</b>
on the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body.  No tears, but terribly 
quiet.

What do we do?

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Same thing we were doing.  We get the fuck.

<b>RANE
</b>
What if there's more?  Let's stay here and let the army guys deal.  
Someone will come... I mean, where are the fucking army guys?

St Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Doctor.  You know what that thing is?

<b>WREN
</b>
I do.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
And there's others.  How many?

The doctor looks around, almost guiltily.

<b>WREN
</b>
Thirty.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Thirty!  We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those 
things.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
There'll be more.

Everyone looks around at her.  She is squatting in the corner facing 
away from them.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
They'll breed.  In a few hours there'll be twice that number.

(she stands, approaches them)

So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
You bought your ticket when you killed that thing. welcome aboard.

<b>CALL.
</b>
Are you fucking crazy? She doesn't care if we....

CHRISTIE (fiercely)

You got no authority here, Call!- Now secure it!

It's the first time Christie has raised his voice, and it has the 
desired effect.

After a silent moment, Call starts again softly.

<b>CALL
</b>
Christie, she's not human.  Wren cloned her because she was carrying an 
alien in her.

She could turn --

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Nobody cares about your opinion, you bitch, you fucking mole --

<b>CALL
</b>
She'll turn on us!  Just like that!

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
I don't give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or 
not. If we've got a wish to live then we work together, and that 
includes bug-lady.

<b>CALL
</b>
You can't trust her.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
I don't trust anyone.  CUT TO: INT.  CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER

The group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the 
cellblock where 

Ripley had been.  DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, 
looking about them.

They are followed by Christie and Wren.

<b>WREN
</b>
There's a console in the guards, station.  We can punch up a diagnostic 
of the ship and plan a route.  To your ship.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
That likes me fine.

He signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously.

<b>ANGLE: HILLARD
</b>
Gently lays her coat over Elgyn's face. Johner looks down a moment.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Via con Dios, man.

Hillard stands. Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, 
a distrustful look on her face.

Ripley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of 
fascinated detatchment.

Call looks back at her.  Ripley smiles, coldly.

<b>ANGLE: IN THE CELLBLOCK
</b>
The group makes their way slowly, quietly.  They approach a bank of 
elevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway.  They are about 
to go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival.

The group backs up, spreads out. Those who can find cover take it. guns 
drawn.

The elevator doors open.  It is too dark inside to see:

Suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a 
figure appears in the light.

Everyone jolts, about to fire. before they realize it is

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Who sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide. twitchier 
than they.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Oh, fuck...

<b>CALL
</b>
vriess!

VRIESS (mock casual)

Hey, whatchyou guys doing?  Hey, Annalee.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Thought you were toast for certain.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
You've seen that fucking thing?

WREN (suspiciously)

Where were you?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
I was down by -- what do you mean? I was in maintenance, checking out 
your oxidation systems.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Doc's got a bug up his ass 'cause Call's a mole and he thinks we're a 
conspiracy.

VRIESS (looking at Call)

She's a what?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
A mole.  A fucking spy.

Vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
We got'a mission here, people.  Let's keep moving.

They do.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  GUARDS, STATION - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
<b>ANGLE: THE CONSOLE
</b>
A hologram of the ship appears above the screen.  It looks a solid as 
the ship itself, except that parts of it occasional break themselves 
down to show interiors.

The group looks it over. Parts of the ship are simply not there, the 
sections around those holes red.  Wren points them out.

<b>WREN
</b>
We've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- 
Jesus, right by the engine room.  We're very lucky.

ST JUST (sarcastically)

Lucky we.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
What about the Betty?  Our ship.

<b>WREN
</b>
The dock seems to be intact.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Then we head for it.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Can we track those fucking things?

<b>WREN
</b>
No.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it!

<b>RANE
</b>
Are you toting a better fucking idea?

<b>WREN
</b>
All of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the 
barracks.

There's no reason to suppose they'd move

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
They won't.

Everybody looks at her.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
They're breeding. They've got new bodies to work on. They'll stay 
close. If they send anybody out, it'll be here. Where the... meat is.

<b>CALL
</b>
'The meat' . Jesus.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
They're breeding.  How long does that take?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Hours.

<b>WREN
</b>
Or less.  The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned 
cells.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Faster we get from here to there, the better.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
With all the devils of hell in between.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Well, if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple.

(to Vriess)

No offense.

VRIESS (giving him the finger)

None taken.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Nobody's left behind, Johner. Not even you.

Her voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
So what's our route?

<b>WREN
</b>
I'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked 
on both sides here,

I'm not sure

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
Sir?  There is the lift.

<b>WREN
</b>
Show me.

DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's 
indicating revealed.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
The lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to 
engineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a 
maintenece access tunnel here

(points to the center of the shaft)

that runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Sounds reasonable.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
I don't have the code for the access tunnel door.

<b>WREN
</b>
I can override.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
(indicating the route)

Then we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom 
of the shaft.

Up, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free.

<b>ANGLE: VRIESS
</b>
Is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair.  He toss one of his 
shotguns to Hillard.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
They never check the chair...

He pulls out a grenade launcher.  It's so compact it's almost cute, 
cradled one handed like an uzi.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Call.

She looks around and he tosses it to her.  The gesture is not 
acconmpanied by any show of warmth.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Try not to shoot your foot off.

<b>WREN
</b>
You people should know --

<b>ST JUST
</b>
We.won't shoot at the windows, Doc.

<b>WREN
</b>
No. The aliens, they bleed molecular acid.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
That's right, I saw that.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
So did I.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
We can't shoot them?  Fuck that, I'm shooting them.

<b>WREN
</b>
This is a big vessel, and for the most part we should be okay. But if 
we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them...

He indicates the hologram, the sections of the ship missing.  Everyone 
gets it.

<b>CHISTIE
</b>
If we're clear then let's get on it. We'll go by twos --

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
We're moving.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
What?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
The ship is moving. 1 can feel it.

<b>RANE
</b>
I don't feel shit -- what, do you mean they're piloting this fucking 
thing?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
This ship has stealthrun, even if we were moving there's no way she 
could feel it.

CALL  She's right.

Call is working the computer now.

<b>CALL
</b>
The ship's been going since the attack.

<b>WREN
</b>
It's uh, it's standard, I think.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
That's right. If the ship takes on any serious damage it autopilots 
back to homebase.

CALL (to Wren, pissed)

You were planning to let us know this?

<b>WREN
</b>
I forgot.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
What is homebase?

<b>WREN
</b>
Earth.

<b>CALL
</b>
Oh, God.  Oh, you bastard...

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Earth?  I'm not going to that fucking slum.

<b>CALL
</b>
If those things get to Earth, It'll be...

RIPLEY (not very concerned).

The end.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
That's not our problem.

<b>CALL
</b>
We've got to blow the ship.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
We don't have to do anything till we get off it.  How long till we get 
there?

<b>CALL
</b>
Three hours.  Almost.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Then that's what we got.  Let's move.

<b>CALL
</b>
Don't you understand what this means?

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
I understand my hide.  And I like it on me. Let's go.

(to Ripley)

What are you called, Ripley?  You mind taking point?

She moves to the head of the line, and they start.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LABS - LATER
</b>
As they progress.  Everyone with a gun has it at the ready.  Ripley is 
a few yards in front.

She stops, sniffs.  Listens.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Clear.

Johner moves up next to her.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
You've come up against these things before?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Yes.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
So what did you do ?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I died.

He lags behind a bit, thrown.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
That wasn't really what I wanted to hear...

DiStephano points to a door.

<b>DISTEPFANO
</b>
This way.

And Ripley leads them in.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LAB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
As Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed.  Ripley 
surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their 
horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one.

Among the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Fuck me ...

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Let's keep moving.

The door to the next chamber is ajar. Christie and Vriess in, then St 
Just, then Ripley.

<b>INT..NEXT CHAMBER
</b>
Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS 
into her side, throwing her off balance.

St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure 
cowering in the corner.

Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with 
terror.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
Get away from me!

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Drop the rod, man.  Do it!

<b>PURVIS.
</b>
Get away...

But the energy is out of him.  The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He 
looks weakly from face to face.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
What's going on?

St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Purvis.  What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost 
ship.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
What ship?  Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew 
for the nickel refinery...

I wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ...

<b>CALL
</b>
Look, you come with us.  It's dangerous here.

Ripley SNIFFS.  Cocks her head.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Leave him.

<b>CALL
</b>
Fuck you.  We're not leaving anyone on this boat.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
He's carrying..

<b>JOHNER
</b>
He's what?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
He's got one....	inside him. I can smell it.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
Inside me? What?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Shit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
It's a bad risk.

<b>CALL
</b>
We can't just leave him.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
I thought you came here to stop them from spreading.

CALL (to Wren, torn)

Isn't there a process, can't you stop it?

<b>ST JUST
</b>
We've got no time for that.

<b>WREN
</b>
I couldn't do it here. The lab's torn apart.

ST JUST (quietly)

I could do him. Painless, back of the head. Might be the best way.

<b>CALL
</b>
There's gotta be another way. If we freeze him --

<b>PURVIS
</b>
<b>WHAT'S IN-FUCKING-SIDE ME?!?!?
</b>
They all look at him, a bit sheepishly.

<b>WREN
</b>
A parasite.  A foreign element that ....

Ripley steps in front of the doctor.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
There's a monster in your stomach. They (indicating the smugglers) 
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put 
an alien in you. In a few hours it will punch  its way through your 
chest and you'll die.  Any questions?

Purvis is wide-eyed, stunned.  After a moment he stammers

<b>PURVIS
</b>
Who are you?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I'm the monster's mother.

She starts heading out of the chamber.  Call turns to the others.

<b>CALL
</b>
He comes with us.  We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to 
remove it later.

<b>WREN
</b>
All right.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Since when are you in fucking charge?

<b>CALL
</b>
Since you were born without balls.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Ease off, people.

CHRISTIE (to Purvis, herding him along)

Come with us.  You might even live.  Get twitchy on me and you will be 
shot.

They move out.

<b>CUT-TO: INT.  HALL - LATER
</b>
still in the same general area, still looking around every corner.  
It's been too quiet too long, and the group senses that &amp; They move 
into

<b>INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM TWO - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It's in bad shape, so we might not recognize it as the chamber the 
queen was in.

<b>WREN
</b>
She's gone.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Who?

<b>WREN
</b>
The Queen.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Good.

He is loooking into the room.the queen was kept in.  A residue of slime 
is all that's left here.

Beyond the queen's chamber is another observation room.  Wren indicates 
that they have to go through.

Suddenly a burner blast FIRES at them, just missing them as they duck.

They hear more blasts, not aimed at them, and screams.

<b>SOLDIER (O.S.)
</b>
Pull back!   Pull back!

<b>OTHER SOLDIER (O.S.)
</b>
It's on me!

Ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a 
group of soldiers.

Call instantly moves to attack, and Ripley grabs her, holds tight.

<b>CALL
</b>
We've got to help them!

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Can't.

<b>CALL
</b>
You bitch, let go of me!

She does, and Call rises.

The noise is gone. What she can see of the soldiers-is parts.

She is shaking at the vision when an alien RISES in front on the 
soldiers.  Call ducks back down, terrified.

Christie hisses at her.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
You want to get yourself killed, then you run solo.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
How many?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
At least two.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Think they heard us?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Yep.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Fine by me ...

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Yeah, let 'em come.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Wren.  Any other way around?

Wren shakes his head.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
We can't just walk in there.

WREN (thinking)

No. No, but they can.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Say again?

<b>WREN
</b>
The cages all have failsafes.  Liquid nitrogen.  Get 'em to come to us 
and I can freeze em.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Excellent.   Get-ready.

Wren goes over to the failsafe button. The others look out at the 
aliens.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Okay... (calls out) Hey!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Hey, guys!

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Here, kitty...

The aliens react, start for the cage.  Four 'of them.  They reach the 
edge of it and stop.

Look around, at each other..

But go nowhere.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
They're not coming.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Hey!  Fresh meat here!

<b>RIPLEY.
</b>
They know it's a trap.

<b>RANE
</b>
Oh, bullshit!

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
What do we do?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Shoot the fucking things!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
There's too many, and we don't have the angle.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Bait.

<b>CALL
</b>
What?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Give em a reason to go in there. Throw somebody in.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Fuck you!

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
DO we want to live? Give em her.

She indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest 
about this idea.

Ripley points at Rane.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Or the skinny one, it doesn't matter. We can't resist the smell of 
meat.

<b>CALL
</b>
We ?

<b>JOHNER 
</b>
Fuck, I'm with her!  Give 'em Annalee!

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Now hold on

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
You people are insane.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Now you're not exactly in the club either, soldier.

People start pointing guns at each other.

<b>RANE
</b>
Fuck you all, I'm not dying for you.

<b>CALL
</b>
Stop this.

Ripley grabs her.  Looks at the others.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Come on!  Do you want to live or not?

(to Call) It won't hurt long.

CALL (terrified)

Noo...

RIPLEY (to Wren)

<b>NOW!
</b>
Wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage 
-- they're almost to the posse, people screaming, scrambling, when the 
freezing gas hits, turning the beasts to statues.

The forth one sees this and flees, but St Just stands and put four 
bullets in it from forty yards. It slumps over.

Everyone is silent, stunned.  Breathing hard.

VRIESS (realizes)

Fear.

Ripley nods.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
That's how they knew it was a trap.  They couldn't smell the fear.

RIPLEY (looking at Call)

So I gave them some.

JOHNER (gleefully)

Son of a bitch!

He pops up and FIRES at the frozen aliens - - they EXPLODE into 
fragments.

<b>CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA
</b>
Gildihg through space, passing Jupiter's moons with dazzling speed.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  HALL   LATER
</b>
Ripley and Call are on point.  Ripley looks down the hall.  Call is 
staring at her, and

Ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back.

RIPLEY(without looking around)

Did you think I was going to... feed you to them?

<b>CALL
</b>
I think you still might.

Ripley smiles.  She may be right.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I want to live.

<b>CALL
</b>
And you don't care about anything else.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
No.

CALL (bitterly)

I guess you're more human than I thought.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Why did you come here?

<b>CALL
</b>
To kill you, remember? (after a beat) Because somebody has to.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
well it's not me.  I did my time.  Now I just want to...

She stops dead, staring at a door.

CLONING STORAGE FACILITY is written on it. Stencilled beneath that is 
`numbers 1-7`.

Ripley stares. Tries the door, which opens.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
That's not the way.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing.

Ripley is looking down at her arm, at the 8 tattooed on it.

She looks at Call.  Looks back at wren.

<b>WREN
</b>
Ripley... don't.

She enters.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CLONING STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
She stands a moment, staring, before proceeding through it.  Call 
stands in the doorway, others crowding behind her. Every face registers 
the horror of what they are seeing, but none more so than Ripley's

Numbers one through seven.  The first failed efforts to clone Ripley.

They are lined up like museum exhibits -- or side show freaks.

Here is the fetal Ripley, the fetal alien visible through its 
translucent chest.

In a jar.

Here is a prematurely old, diseased Ripley, withered blue skin cling to 
Collapsed bones.

Here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host -
- boneless, bubbling tissue, weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew.

Each one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all.

Ripley approaches, and stares at number seven.

A complete mixture of alien and human DNA.

A tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare.

Hooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head 
nearly level with

Ripley's as she finally approaches it.

When it opens its eyes, they are hers.

it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her.  Recognises her.

Ripley cannot even speak.  She begins to shake slightly looking at 
number seven.

<b>NUMBER SEVEN
</b>
Kill ... us ...

Ripley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling 
a mouth.

Ripley staggers back a step, shaking now.  This is too much to bear...

<b>CALL
</b>
Ripley!

Ripley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream.

Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK.  Her eyes meet 
Ripley's.

Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it 
Ripley FIRES, a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in 
fire and noise, she FIRES another, tissue and steel exploding into 
flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily...And she 
FIRES, the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame.

Freezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but 
the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber.

She backs out, the crew waiting for her outside.

The launcher falls loudly to the ground.  Ripley turns to Wren, her 
face rigid with pain.

Wren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others 
have no thought of providing.

<b>CALL
</b>
Ripley... Don't do it.

Ripley stops. weariness suffusing her expression.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Don't do what?

The tension pases.  Wren breathes a little sigh of relief.

Call PUNCHES him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses 
to the ground.

Call starts down the hall, not even looking at him.

<b>CALL
</b>
Don't do that.

Feeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this.  
It's kind of winning.

Christie helps him up.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Had it coming, Doc.

Johner looks in at the burning lab.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
What's the big deal?  Fucking waste of ammo.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Let's move before anything comes to check out the noise.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Chicks, man....

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
We go down from here.

CHRISTIE (to Vriess)

We got to lose the chair.  Vriess.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
I know.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Kawlang maneuver, all right?

Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Just like old times...

<b>CUT TO: INT.  ROOM - LATER
</b>
A hatch opens. Ripley drops down, surveys the scene.  Quiet dark, 
empty.

Ripley comes up, Call behind her.  Ripley sniffs, listens.  Closes her 
eyes. After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to 
follow.

Slowly, they make their way down the corridor. Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , 
guns drawn.

Bringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun.. He turn slowly, 
alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other 
way, also with a shotgun.

CALL (to Ripley)

That lab... 1 can't imagine how that must feel.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
No. You can't.

Ripley looks down.  The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark 
water.

Ripley steps into it, moves up a few paces. The others gingerly follow.

Vriess is facing the back. He looks up.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
The cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble.

<b>ANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS
</b>
We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.  There are gaping, 
twisted holes in them.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
The nasties couldn't have done it, could they?

<b>HILLARD
</b>
What for...?

<b>WREN
</b>
Down here. He is at the front with Ripley and-Call, where the water is 
waste deep.

He looks down at a stairwell, just the top of the railing visible above 
the murky water.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
There's no other way?

<b>WREN
</b>
We're at the bottom of the ship.  Some of the worst damage is down 
here.

Most of the sections are sealed off.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You're sure?

<b>WREN
</b>
There's the noncom's entrance back there, but it's flooded too, and 
it's a longer run.

<b>CALL
</b>
He's right.  We're gonna have to do it this way.

<b>WREN
</b>
It's just through the kitchen, then up, maybe seventy feet.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I don't like it.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
What's to like?

CHRISTIE (to vriess)

You ready to get wet, partner?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Oh yeah.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
You sure about the distance?

<b>WREN
</b>
Yes.

<b>CALL
</b>
No locked doors?

<b>WREN
</b>
It's an open hall.  Just keep left when you hit the bottom of the 
staircase.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
This sucks.

<b>ANGLE: DI STEPHANO
</b>
He flips caps over the barrel of the gun, slides a panel over the 
digital readout.

The burner is ready to go, watertight.

DISTEPHMO (to St Just)

You should secure'your weapons.

St Just holds up his two guns.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
These are disposables.  They can take it.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Disposables. I heard about those. How many rounds?

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Twenty. Split points, give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Cool.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
They're big with hitters. 'Cause you throw em away after the job. 
Nobody likes throwing  away a weapon they're attached to.  You know?

He smiles at Di Stephano, who looks a little uneasy about the turn the 
conversation has taken.

He joins the others who are getting ready to dive..

<b>CALL
</b>
Do I have to tell everyone to take a deep breath?

A couple of the guys smile.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Christie, do me a favor.  When we hit the surface on the other side... 
no backstroke.  Okay?

CHRISTIE (laughing)

You'll be forever blowing bubbles. On three...

He counts down, the two suck in enormous breaths -- and dive right 
behind Call and Ripley.

One by one the entire crew slips down into the black water.

<b>CUT TO:  INT.  STAIRWELL\KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It's all underwater.  Visiblity is poor.  The crew move swiftly and 
gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen.

In here it's a tad labyrinthian, and the size of the room it darker. 
Wren heads straight for the other end.

They swim.  Safety is a good fifty feet away.

They are tense, concentrated.  Swimming past dark spaces.  Anything 
could be hiding here.

Johner looks about him, very nervous.  Dark spaces.  He looks behind.

Three aliens are right behind him.

Panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and FIRES 
at them, tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible 
ease.

Ripley, all the way to the stairs, sees.  She hurries the others past 
her.

They swim frantically for safety, Hillard Wren, Christie and Vriess.

Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, 
pull him into it.

Hillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still 
firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot.

Call is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating 
the surface.

She is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB.

A net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the 
surface.

Call struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as 
Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear 
through it, but they are getting weaker.

Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close 
behind.

She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface 
-- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running 
out of air KICKS at it, it  lets go.

The others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but 
it's tough, she  still can't get her head up --

--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful 
of water and begins thrashing.

Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart 
with a mighty heave, she glides up through --

<b>CLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE
</b>
Just BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER 
<b>CLAMPS DOWN ON HER.
</b>
Ripley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the 
surface.

Wren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in 
four shots.

Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, 
in a circular sweep.

They decimate a number of eggs

<b>ANGLE: UNDERWATER
</b>
Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its 
fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint.  
Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing 
horribly.

In utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are 
<b>COMING RIGHT AT HER.
</b>
<b>ABOVE - THE SURFACE
</b>
Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water.  Christie holding a 
facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
Get it!  Kill it!

<b>CALL
</b>
The blood'll burn you!  Throw it!

He does, and Johner nails it in midflight.

Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not 
breathing.

<b>ANGLE: UNDER THE SURFACE
</b>
Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and 
shoots it.

They swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool.

<b>ANGLE: ABOVE THE SURFACE
</b>
They come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them.  
Everyone who can, shoots it.  It falls back into the water.

<b>CHRISTIE
</b>
A trap!  They set a goddamn ambush!

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Give me that!

He pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him 
mouth to mouth.

Johner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing 
SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail 
bubble from below the surface.

JOHNER (grinning feverishly)

Okay!  Everybody out of the pool!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Let's get the fuck!

Di Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand,

HILLARD (to Wren)

Which way?

<b>WREN
</b>
Up here.

He takes off, the others following.

<b>WREN
</b>
Up through the lift shaft!

He stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley 
come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Company!

He's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens.

She herds them into the shaft.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever.. Enough room 
for or three

elevators, one of which is two stories below.

<b>WREN
</b>
<b>UP!
</b>
He starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each 
shaft section.

Call comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders.

They climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin 
POUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Move!

<b>WREN
</b>
Not far!

Still POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls 
it out.

<b>ANGLE: LIFT
</b>
Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet 
from the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad 
beside it as Call climbs up behind him.

The aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft 
to grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming 
up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans 
on ladders.

On one of the aliens a facehugger crawls, constantly moving about on 
the adult alien's head like a frightened spider.

<b>CALL
</b>
Hurry!

<b>WREN
</b>
It's jammed!  Shit!  Gun!

She hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE 
<b>CHEST.
</b>
She flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT, lands HARD on an elevator six 
stories below.

Eyes wide and empty.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
<b>NOO!
</b>
He fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped 
through the opening door..

Ripley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up 
just in time to see  the door shut.  The lock lights turn red.

She SLAMS against the door, but to no avail.

The aliens are getting closer.  St Just, the closest to the bottom, 
suddenly lets go of  the ladder.  His knees hooked over a rung, he 
drops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands.

He blows several holes in the nearest alien.

Ripley is furious, maybe surprised just how so.  Suddenly an alien 
RISES OVER THE LEDGE, it's not three feet away from her and she 
SCREAMS, HURLS herself at it and they both go

FLYING OFF into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall. 

RIPLEY GRABS a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but 
she holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find 
puchase. We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call.

<b>ANGTE: CALLS FACE
</b>
As the facehugger CLAMPS onto it. Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits 
probing Call's nostrils.  Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to 
find a better host.

Another alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess. Vriess 
frantically tries to reload.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
It's on us!

Christie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES, but 
the alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him.  
He SCREAMS, lets go of the ladder

Vriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien 
flying off  and down the shaft.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
We gotta go!

The last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
We're locked in.

<b>JOHNER 
</b>
Fuck!

<b>PURVIS
</b>
How far to the next door?

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
All the way.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Then we climb.

They start, moving as fast as they can.

VRIESSS (to Christie)

You just hang on, man.  I'll get us there.

He starts climbing up, impressively fast considering the burden hanging 
from his back.

JOHNER (to Ripley)

Are they going for reinforcements?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Fucked if I know.

They climb.

And climb, the minutes stretching out, still no door.  Ripley easily 
ahead of the rest.

Finally:

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I think I see the door.

PURVIS (exhausted)

Great.

Vriess is having increasing trouble.  Hillard notices him lagging 
behind, and why.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Vriess!  Jesus!

Vriess is moving very quickly, considering. But the effort is becoming 
too much.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
We're coming...

Johner scrambles down next to Vriess.

he checks the pulse in Christie's neck.

Vriess, man... he's dead.

Refusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
We'll get him to medlab... just a little while ...

Johner looks over at Hillard.  Without saying a word, she pull out a 
good-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open.

She slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body 
falls free.

Vriess shuts his eyes, feeling it.  ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT

There is silence as Christie's body drops down the black abyss

Until, from up the shaft next to where he fell, we see two ALIENS 
<b>COMING UP.
</b>
<b>PURVIS
</b>
Fuck!  Company!

Hillard looks up the shaft.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
How much further?,

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Too fucking far.  Let's G0 !

They start to climb, but the aliens are making much better time.

A loud CLACKING sounds from the bottom of the shaft.  A few of them 
look down.

<b>ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT
</b>
The aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading 
up at high speed.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
They can work the elevators?  Is there anything fucking else we should 
know about them?!

He's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of 
them.

The lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is 
flipped.

They wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead.

<b>CALL
</b>
Get on!

A moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift.

Call drops back down inside.

An alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.  St Just 
shoots the shit out of it.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Where are the others?

<b>CUT TO: INT.  LIFT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Call flips the brake off, and the lift shoots up.  She is holding her 
jacket closed around  her chest wound, but it doesn't seem to bother 
her particularly much.

<b>ANGLE: ON TOP
</b>
Everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft.

<b>ANGLE: INSIDE
</b>
Call waits for the signal to stop and an alien PUNCHES THROUGH the 
bottom of the lift.  Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through, 
clawing for her.

<b>ANGLE:	ON THE BOTTOM
</b>
We see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift.

<b>ANGLE:	ON TOP
</b>
Ripley sees the door approaching

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
stop!

<b>ANGLE: INSIDE
</b>
Call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of 
the door -

- giving both Ripley and Call access.  Bu the alien is still grabbing 
for her --

Ripley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall. 
Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors

The alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs 
Call's ankle, but

Ripley wrenches her free.

They roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside 
the lift.

Ripley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the 
lift.  FIRES.

The lift PLUMMIETS, the alien still halfway in.

It shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way 
down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as--

The lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens 
to jelly.

<b>ANGLE:	UPPER DOOR
</b>
Johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Eat that, fuckneck!!

They all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next 
stretch. 

Call stands with her back to them.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Baby, am I glad to see you.  I thought dickbag took you out for sure.  
Are you, hurt?

<b>CALL
</b>
I'm fine.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
You got body armour on?

<b>CALL
</b>
Yeah.  Come on.

Ripley isn't buying.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You were Gunshot.  I saw.

<b>CALL
</b>
I'm fine!

Ripley spins her around.  Call stares at Ripley, sullenly a small 
trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril. Ripley looks down.

<b>ANGLE: CALL'S CHEST
</b>
Wren has indeed made a messy hole here, but where blood and bone should 
be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring.  To state the obvious:

A robot.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Call's a goddam sythetic!

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Son of a bitch.  Little Annalee's just full of surprises.

RIPLEY (quietly)

I should have known.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Couldn't smell this one out?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
No, I mean... all that crap about being human - there's no one so 
zealous as a Born Again.

VRIESS (to Call)

You're an LM7, aren't you?  Is that it?

<b>CALL
</b>
Leave me alone.

Her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by 
the wounds.

The voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Call ....

CALL (bitterly)

Yes.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
LM7?  Shit.  That explains a lot.

YRIESS (to Ripley)

The latest and best.  They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic 
industy.

Instead they buried it.

Ripley looks at the girl.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
They were-too good.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Oh yeah.  Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors.  Didn't feel like 
being told what to do.

The government ordered a recall.  Fucking massacre.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man... I never 
thought I'd see one.

Johner starts laughing.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Oh, Christ.  Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second 
hand junk to the farm belt... and we're carrying the most expensive 
piece of contraband in the system.

That's rich.

PURVIS (getting anxious)

It's great, she's a toaster oven... Can we leave now?

Vriess tries to touch Call's wound.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Let me see.

Call pulls away.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Yeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess.

Maybe she just needs an oil change.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Let's go.

They start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Can't believe I almost fucked the thing.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Yeah, like you've never fucked a robot.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
Letting DiStephano lead.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
DiStephano.  Where are we?

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Upper decks... Storage... the chapell's up here, not much else.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Can we get to the ship?

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Well, we're a ways out,of the way, but I think we can get through to 
the garden.

From there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able.

What if the fucking doctor gets there first?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
It's a good point.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Shit.

They have reached an access door.  Debris blocks the way.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Another way?

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Uh, yeah.  Through the wall.  We'll have to get one of these panels 
off.  It'll take a while.

(to Vriess) You got tools?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Yeah, but no torch.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Fucking blow the door!

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Assface, We're on the top of this thing.

(pointing to the ceiling)

That's hull.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
What about Wren? if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us 
around.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
We have to get in too.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
There's no access console on this level. We'd have to-backtrack.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Fuck that.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
And I don't have the security access that Wren does anyway.

Ripley turns to Call.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Call.

<b>CALL
</b>
No. I can't.

<b>JOHNER.
</b>
Bullshit.  She's a damn well talking machine.

<b>CALL
</b>
There's another way.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
Just tell her to access it on remote.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Shit, that's right.  Any of the new model droids can access the 
mainframe.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Just by blinking.

<b>CALL
</b>
I can't.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
No time to get coy, Annalee.

<b>CALL
</b>
I can't. I burned my modem drive.  We all did.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
You can still patch in manually. You know that.

Call looks over at the group, staring at her.  She knows she doesn't 
have a choice.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
There's ports in the chapel.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Come on.

(to the others)

You get started on that wall.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOU@
</b>
Ripley and Call enter the small room.  Ripley sits in one of the pews, 
pulls out a bible.

it somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen 
reading.:

<b>HOLY BIBLE.  PRE START.
</b>
Ripley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up

<b>CALL
</b>
Don't make me do this.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Don't make me make you.

<b>CALL
</b>
I don't want to go in there.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Get over it.

<b>CALL
</b>
It's like... your insides are liquid. It's not real.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You can blow the ship.  Before it reaches Earth.  Kill them all.  Just 
give us time to get

out first.

That convinces Call.  She pulls up her sleeve, and begins. pushes a 
part of her forearm,

just below the crook of her elbow.  It has a spring release catch, and 
a small panel rises

up with two computer ports on it.  She takes the cable from Ripley and 
plugs it in.

It looks almost like she's mainlining heroin.

She cocks her head.

<b>CALL
</b>
Dammit.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Anything?

<b>CALL
</b>
Hold on.

She reaches in her chest, reconnects some tubes.  She twitches then 
shuts her eyes.

It's beginning.

She begins speaking very rapidly, eyes still shut.

<b>CALL
</b>
Breach in sector seven sector three sector nine unstable -- engines 
operating at eighty

six percent -forty six minutes until earthdock.

Her voice has a slight mechanical quality as she rattles this off.  Her 
eyes open.

<b>CALL
</b>
We burned too much energy -- I can't make critical mass.  I can't blow 
it.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Then crash it.

<b>TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
As the crew works at getting the wall panel off,.

<b>TO: INT.  CHAPPEL   A BIT LATER
</b>
<b>CALL
</b>
Ground level recalibrated... new destination 760, 403.  Done.  Forty 
one minutes until impact.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Try to clear us a path to the ship.

<b>CALL
</b>
Tracking movement in sublevels six through nine.  Video is down.  
Attempted rerouting

nonfunctional, wait, partial visual in waste tank 5, unauthorized

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Unauthorized?

<b>CALL
</b>
Nonhuman.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
How many?

Please wait.. emergency override on. console 45V, level one... 
handprint ID...

(like herself)

It's Wren. 	He's almost at the Betty.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
And how do	you feel about that?

<b>CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Wren is holding his hand to the scanner, just as Call described.  The 
red light turns

green and we hear the locks the door crack open.

<b>FATHER
</b>
Emergency override validated.

The door begins to rise.  Looking around him, Wren waits to through.

The door grinds to a halt, still too low to climb under.  The lights go 
out, only the faintest glow coming from various instrument panels. 
wren's expression drains.

<b>WREN
</b>
Father, reboot systems on 45V, authorization 'starling'.

Nothing happens.  Wren looks about him, beginning to sweat.

Did the aliens do this?

<b>WREN
</b>
Father, locate power drain, report.

Father?

CALL - (on the system)

Father's dead, asshole.

Wren spins in shock at the sound of Call's voice. it,s everywhere 
around him.

She has downloaded her vocal matrix place of Father's. 

(She's not just speaking over a PA, she is the PA.)

The door SLAMS back-down, locks clack into place.  The doors behind him 
open up, 

emergency lighting pulsing along toward him.

<b>CALL\SHIP
</b>
Intruder on level one... all aliens please proceed to level one.

Wren is freaking.  He turns back down the corridor, looking about him 
wildly.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Call pulls the cord out of her port.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You got a mean strak.

<b>CALL
</b>
It's done.  That should hold the fuck.

This as her voice track slips even more.  She works the wires in her 
cheest, trying

to fix it.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Let me see

<b>CALL
</b>
Don't touch me.

Ripley backs off.

<b>CALL
</b>
You must think this is pretty funny.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Yes.  But I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.  And I'm not sure 
they are.

<b>CALL
</b>
Why do you go on living?  How can you stand it?  How can you stand... 
yourself?

Ripley shrugs.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Not so hard.  Not much choice.

<b>CALL
</b>
At least there's part of you that's human.  I'm just... fuck.  Look at 
me....

She looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers.

<b>CALL
</b>
I'm disgusting.

Her voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie.  It's a mechanical 
problem, but 

it sounds just like despair.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Do you dream?

<b>CALL
</b>
I ... we have neural processors that run through....  (stops)  Yes.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
When I sleep, I dream about it.  Them.  Every night.  All around me ... 
in me. 

I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore.

<b>CALL
</b>
Why?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Because no matter how bad the dreams get ... when I wake up it's always 
worse.

Purvis enters.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
I guess we're almost there.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Right.

He exits again.  Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring.  We 
hear her voice slip back to normal as she says:

<b>CALL
</b>
Let's get going.

<b>CUT TO: INT. TUNNEL
</b>
As they come one by one through the wall.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Not far now.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
God, I'm so tired...

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Yeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead.

Ripley follows him through.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Don't count on it.

The rest of them come through and walk into:

<b>INT.  THE GARDEN    CONTINUOUS
</b>
The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a 
terraced slope.

Everywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, 
exotic and experimental hybrids.

Access paths crisscross the beds.

It's huge, the single biggest space on the ship.  Yet the low ceiling, 
laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous 
undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic.

From where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
What's this fucking deal?

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
This supplies most of the food for the unit.

VRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear)

You guys got something against spam?

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
And there's some lab work here too. Hybridization.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
At the other end?

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
Runs down to the by the waste tanks.  We can get to the dock from 
there.  You, okay?

Ripley is holding her head.  She shuts her eyes.

<b>CALL
</b>
What is it?

Ripley shakes it off.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Nothing.  I'm okay.

She looks out at the jungle, they have to cross.

<b>CALL
</b>
We should get moving.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Hey!  Check it out!

He has come upon a small loading truck, a sort of platform jeep.  
Vriess checks it out, takes a huge bite of his pear.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Beats walking.

He hauls himself up-into it. Everybody piles onto the back flatbed just 
a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but 
Vriess, Call and Ripley, who pushes into the driver's seat.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Quickly and quietly, people.

Ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till Call 
flips on the ignition.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Thank,you.

The jeep pulls out.  It's electric, so it emits just a low hum as she 
takes it at a good clip toward the other side.

The access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself, plants 
rising tall all around them.

Ripley concentrates on driving.

The pass through as section of wheat , then of corn.  As they come to 
another section,

The crew's expressions change to one of pleased disbelief.

You gotta be fucking me. St Just!  Is this real?

<b>ST JUST
</b>
So this is what heaven looks like.

We see they have driven into a healthy section of CANNABIS plants 
growing ten feet high.

The car screeches to a halt.  Ripley's at a crossroads of sorts.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Which way?

HILLARD (looking at the plants)

I always wondered where the military got its funding...

An alien SHOOTS out of the brush and lands on Hillard everyone SCREAMS 
-- Ripley SLAMS her foot on the pedal

The jeep PEELS OUT, as more emerge from the brush.

<b>HILLARD
</b>
Get it off MeeeaaaaAAGGHRE!!!!

It bores into her head before St Just can blow it away. It's head 
exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from 
the jeep, Hillard's body still clutched in arms.

Another leaps out at them, but the jeep is going a good clip and it 
misses.

The crew peppering it with bullets.

They look,about them, guns ready.

<b>ANGLE: IN THE BRUSH
</b>
Something runs parallel to them in the plants.

<b>ANGLE: ABOVE
</b>
Two more run on top of the grow-lamps, pacing them as well.

One DROPS DOWN -- Ripley SWERVES out of the way, driving in the plants.

They are varied, exotic -- and there are aliens behind half of them.

The crew BLASTS away all around them Ripley drives a drunkard's path 
through the brush, avoiding trees that dot the scape.

An alien DROPS onto the hood, another grabs the side -- Vries takes out 
the first, blowing it off, but the second grabs Johner, he goes flying 
over the side,.dropping his gun.

St Just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see 
that Johner is being

dragged, the alien still clutching onto him.

Shots bang out, ripping into the alien, which lets go. Johner looks up 
to see Purvis  holding Johner's gun.

Johner drags himself back on.

One jumps down onto St Just, tears a good chunk out of his midsection 
before he dusts it.

Another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep SAILS over first ledge 
of the terraced  slope, comes-down hard enough knock it off, SAILS over 
the next -- the crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope 
after slope. 

Ripley swerves back onto the road, the jeep sliding over onto the steps 
beside it, rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope, 
the aliens close on their heels.

Still blasting away at the beasts, the crew is able to put little 
distance between them as they come to the end of the garden.  Here it 
divides into three sections, all open halls with access for the jeep.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Which way?

DISTEPRMO (looking over)

Left!  Left!

She swerves left, the jeep-bouncing into the hall

<b>INT.  HALL CONTINUOUS
</b>
Where windows running along either side look out onto black space.

Ripley drives as far as she can, till a staircase -- going -- fills her 
vision, too steep

for the jeep.  She SLAMS on brakes. the jeep spinning out and coming to 
a halt.

The crew piles out, Di Stephano grabbing Vriess.  At the other end of 
the hall, the aliens

can be seen approaching.

The crew BLASTS at them, the aliens, blood splattering the narrow hall.

<b>ANGLE: THE BLOOD
</b>
Eating into the walls. the floor.

CALL/Ship

Warning. potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

DISTEPHANO (indicating the steps)

Down here!

They start down -- all but St Just.  He gets out of the jeep with 
difficulty.

Looks down at his wound.

Johner looks around to see him still standing atop the steps

<b>JOHNER
</b>
St Just!  Come on, man.

St Just looks down at the wound. Back at Johner.  He walks calmly away, 
towards the aliens.

<b>CALL
</b>
St Just!

<b>ST JUST
</b>
You go.

He looks at the appraching aliens.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
I'm bored.

<b> CALL\SHIP
</b>
Warning.  Evacuate sector.

A moment, then the crew takes off.

St Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth.  Only the 
slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens.

They close on him, and he raises his guns.

<b>CALL\SHIP
</b>
warning...

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT HALL NEARBY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The crew runs full out.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
We have to get out of the sector!

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Where!

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
There!

He points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall.

<b>CUT TO: INT. HALL CONTINUOUS
</b>
The aliens close, and St Just FIRES, blasting away with bot guns.  
Aliens writhe on the

floor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still 
he fires, 

Call\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos

-- St Just fires until both guns are empty.  In one smooth motion he 
drops them both 

and jerks his wrists and TWO-MORE disposable guns fly into his palms 
and he blasts away

<b>ANGLE: THE BLOOD
</b>
Eating through the hull.

<b>ANGLE: THE CREW
</b>
desperately racing for the door.

<b>ANGLE: ST JUST
</b>
Firing with quiet glee.

<b>ANGLE: THE CREW
</b>
The first of them are through the door.

ANGLE: St JUST

The aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his 
guns click, spent.

<b>ST JUST
</b>
Damn.

<b>CALL\SHIP
</b>
Warning --

and BOOM!!!!, the hall BURSTS OPEN, everything explodes into space, the 
wind rushes out as

BOOM!!!, the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
is the last to get out, but the pressure change SUCKS HER she flies 
backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she SLAMS into 
it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the 
door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds.

The others have exited into the next hall.  They've been tossed about, 
but not as badly.

Call stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up.  Ripley is dazed; the 
door hit the back of her head solidly.

<b>CALL
</b>
Can you walk?  RIPLEY

I think I...

<b>CALL
</b>
I'm not fucking carrying you

Ripley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out. Ripley 
puts her hands over her ears.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Mistake ... mistake...

<b>CALL
</b>
Ripley.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I can hear them, in the hive... it's close...	We're on the hive.

<b>CALL
</b>
Jesus.  Come on.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I can hear them... the queen...

<b>CALL
</b>
What... ?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
She's in pain.

They CRASH UP through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the 
two women.

Call can barely spin before Ripley GRABS her and HURLS her fifteen feet 
down the corridor, out of harm's way.

The aliens close on Ripley. She struggles but she's still weak.  One 
slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley

As the aliens drag her unconscious body back down under the floor.

<b>CALL
</b>
<b>RIPLEY!
</b>
<b>CUT TO: INT.  AIR VENT - CONINUOUS
</b>
Dark, cramped, and already covered with a hardening layer of resin.

Skittering, insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens, as two of 
them crawl rapidly along.   The third craw upside down, the 
semiconscious Ripley draped over its chest  If she were awake, and 
out.vf her mind, she could be kissin the beast.

Her eyes flutter open, but she is obviously still groggy.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S POV
</b>
Alien head, dark tunnel passing beneath.

Scuttling through a small maze, the aliens come out into:

<b>INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
A vast, dark chamber, entirely encrusted with alien goo. air vent opens 
about three quarters of the way up the chamber. The aliens pour out and 
imediately scuttle UP, carrying Ripley to the top of the chamber.

They circle her and begin secreting resin, spinning a web around her.

The resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs.

It isn't pleasant, and Ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon 
her.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  ANTECHAMBER   CONTINUOUS
</b>
The crew piles through it on their way to the loading dock.

Call brings up the rear, still looking back regretfully.

She hesitates, and Purvis takes hold of her arm.

<b>PURVIS
</b>
We got to be moving, miss.  Best gift you can give her right now is a 
quick death.

<b>CALL
</b>
It's not right...

<b>PURVIS
</b>
I've been saying that all day, we need your help.

A moment more, and she heads out with him.

<b>CUT TO: WASTE, TANK 5 - CONTINUOTJS
</b>
The aliens have finished webbing Ripley, and climb away. 

When it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling, her 
legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof. She hangs 
therefore at an angle, looking down on the chamber. 

And so it is with her, as she swims to full consciousness, we get our 
first real look at where we are.

There are no less than ten people strung up exactly as Ripley is, 
encircling the chamber, and all looking some forty feet down at:

The Queen.  Lying on her back at the bottom of the-chamber, belly 
swollen and distended.

She is herself partially cocooned, strapped down to the at the edge of 
a black pool of blood and ichor.  Her head moves slowly back and forth, 
in delierium of pain.

There are a four or five aliens tending her, spinning goo around her, 
vomiting blood onto her belly. They might be serving her, or 
imprisoning her.  Both, in fact.

There is one thing missing from this tableau.

RIPLEY (softly)

No eggs ...

<b>GEDIMAN (OS)
</b>
Multiple reproductive systems.

Ripley turn's slowly, to see the person next to her.  It's Gediman, 
looking wane and haggard.

He may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead, his eyes 
glowing with near insanity.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Complete asexual reproductive cycle, self-impregnating, we found six 
different sets of ovaries in her.  Egg laying is the first cycle, 
immature.  Redundancies, redundancies

... she'll bring forth legion.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
They didn't impregnate you?

Now he looks at her, regret and glee at what has happened battling for 
his expression.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
No... they've just been draining me.

She looks down, to see

<b>ANGLE : GEDIMAN'S FEET
</b>
As blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes, dripping into 
the pool.

A keening SHRIEK comes out of the queen, as her limbs begin thrashing.

The aliens around her back off slightly. 

The bulge in her belly starts moving.

Ripley starts struggling with her bonds, terror and determination in 
her.eyes.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I'm getting	out of here. Goddamnit, I'm getting the	fuck out of here!

He looks at her, the last glimmerof his sanity sinking beyond the 
horizon.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Don't you want to see what happens next?

<b>CUT TO: INT: LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The crew rushes in, heads for the Betty.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
How long till we can get airborn?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
I'll need Call to patch in to the ship again, open the hatch.

<b>CALL
</b>
Right.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
We hit atmo in a few minutes, only gonna make it harder.

They all run on board

<b>INT.  THE BETTY
</b>
and head for the cockpit.  DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair.

<b>CALL
</b>
Johner, take Purvis to the freezer.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
All right.. Nap time, buddy.

A GUNSHOT and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, 
Johner draws but

Wren emerges from the shadows too fast.

Wren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right 
below her shoulderblades.

<b>WREN
</b>
Fuck with me and I put a bullet where her brain is!

Johner stands, uncertain.

<b>WREN
</b>
DiStephano!  Take their weapons.

<b>DISTEPHANO
</b>
Begging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck.

DiStephano aims at Wren.  Wren backs up a step.

<b>WREN
</b>
Drop it!  Drop it or we all die together!

Heaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward.  His eyes go 
wide.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5   CONTINUOUS
</b>
Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds.  It's just beginning 
to work.

But the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated 
as the Queens belly begins moving more violently.  SHRIEKS, and RIPLEY 
does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as

THE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN.  Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the 
walls.

And all the screaming stops.  The movement stops.  Even Ripley stops.  
Silence.

Something emerges from the wound.

An alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch 
out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous 
haunches, thick and powerful.

Its head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse 
red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to 
the back.

It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its 
tongue does.

Its much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself.

And it's bone white.

<b>GEDIMAN
</b>
Beautiful.... beautiful butterfly...

He is crying with revelatory joy.  Ripley is not.  Grimacing the sight 
and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds.

One of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes 
up.

Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a 
burner.

<b>SOLDIER
</b>
No, God...

He SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror.  The newborn stops, tilting its 
head:

It LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a 
monstrous flea.

Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with 
its four forelegs as he screams lustily.

pincers SWING out and pin either side of his head.. His eyes go wide 
as:

Its tongue SHOOTS into his throat.  Stays there, and we watch it drain 
the blood from his body.  We can see it, see its stomach swell, red 
tinged, as his body goes

blue and slack. His rifle drops into the black pool.

Gediman stares, transfixed, and it LANDS ON HIM.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Johner's gun drops to the floor.

Everyone backs off.

<b>WREN
</b>
The fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it 
according to standard operational procedure.

<b>CALL
</b>
No she's not.

<b>DISTEPHMO
</b>
You're fucking nuts.  You still want to bring those things back to 
earth?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Have you been paying any attention today?

<b>WREN
</b>
I can handle the animals!

<b>CALL
</b>
Fucking shoot me.

<b>WREN
</b>
Shut up!!!

And Purvis LAUNCHES from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren 
gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face.  The 
soldier drops like a sack.

The other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis SLAMS his 
fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, 
rolling, grabbing his gun --

Purvis is a man possessed.  He grabs Wren's gunhand and SMAS it against 
an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun.

Purvis jerks.  Blood blooms in his chest.

Everybody stops, mesmerized. wren drops to his knees, going for the 
gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of 
Wren's head is against his chest.

Purvis jerks again.  It takes Wren a moment to understand what's 
happening.

They both scream.

Then alien BURSTS out of Purvis's chest, STRAIGHT INTO WRENS SKULL.

Everyone else is still frozen.  Then the little critter bursts out of 
Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess.  CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5 -

</b>
Ripley TEARS one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her.

Gediman is already a shell.

Having drained the scientist, it leaps blindingly fast onto the 
ceiling.  Looks around.

Targets Ripley.

It has no eyes, but she can feel them on her anyway.  She rips at her 
bonds with a terrible effort -- the newborn LEAPS at her and she PULLS 
FREE with a scream, PLUNGING  the thirty feet to the pool as the alien 
flies over her, missing, landing on the far wall instead.

Ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water.

The newborn turns its head, trying to locate its lost prey. other 
aliens scutter closer to the pool.

Ripley stands up out of the pool, covered in blood, HOISTING THE 
<b>SOLDIERIS GUN.
</b>
Killshriek rising from her throat as she FIRES, taking out a host of 
aliens in a single sweep, just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of 
the way.  Aliens jump at her, trying to kill and trying to protect the 
newborns, but she blows them out of the air.

It feels pretty good.

A few shots go wild, and punch big holes in the side of the tank.

Light streams in through them.  Ripley sees -- and continues firing in 
that direction.

She makes a big enough hole that she can run and SMASH through to

<b>INT.  BY TANK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
rolling and coming up in an instant.  She looks around her. exit this 
way, but there is a vent above her.

The newborn's head lunges at her, the small hole making it impossible 
for the creature to get all the way through.  But it wriggles, 
pushing...

Ripley jumps up, grabbing a pipe, and KICKS open the vent grate, 
throwing herself up the vertical shaft with astonishing ease.

<b>CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS---

Vriess is scrambling away, knocking over things to avoid the baby 
alien. 

Johner SHOOTS at the creature as it speeds-towards Vriess.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Look out!

it knocks over cannisters as it speeds across the table and behind some 
instruments.  VRIESS

Where'd it go?

<b>CALL
</b>
Don't shoot it!

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Fuck that!

It LEAPS out of the darkness and heads straight for Call, she stumbles 
back, trips -- it comes at her, leaps right at her face, she pulls her 
hand back -- and-flicks her wrist The stilletto pops out as the creatu 
flies at it, the blade slides right into its mouth, ramming eight 
inches through its innards before it pokes out the other end.

Blood spurts on Call, on the floor.  The creature wriggles and finally 
falls free as the stilletto melts inside it.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Vriess!  Get behind the fucking wheel!

Ripley is climbing up the cramped vent with the speed and agility of an 
alien.

Unfortunately, so are the aliens, twenty feet below her.  Two drones in 
front, with the newborn sqeezing close behind.

Ripley grabs a pole and her hand begins to steam, it's so hot. She 
cries out, lets go...  then looks down.  Grabs the pole again and, 
ignoring the searing agony, pulls, pulls...

RIPS out of the wall, burning steam GUSHING out below her, slowing down 
the aliens.

She continues climbing, then kicks through a grate.

The planet is still blue, but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a

faster than the  planet itself.

The Auriga heads for a section of exposed earth.  Not long now.

Ripley drops to the ground and heads for the dock.

<b>RIPLEY

No!

She doesn't bother to try the door, she HURLS herself through the 
window, landing

in a hail of glass.

She is on the platform that. runs the length of the dock.  Betty. is 
barely visible past the far end, - sinking into the airlock as the 
massive airlock doors. slide slowly shut.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
<b>NO!!
</b>
A SLAM against the metal door behind her tells her the aliens are here.

She picks herself up and RUNS -- and she can run fast.

Speeds across the platform, faster, faster, the Betty sinks of sight as 
the airlock doors move closer together, fifteen feet apart, ten...

Ripley reaches the edge of the platform and LEAPS, just hurls herself 
off of the platform, sails through the air, thirty, forty feet, and 
down, the airlock doors thirty feet below almost closed

She DROPS right through just before they close, falls another fifteen 
feet and lands

and the Betty SHOOTS DOWN out of the airlock -- Ripley and the newborn 
just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the 
hatch door for dear life.

The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it 
too struggles with the sudden drop.

<b>ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA
</b>
Speeding toward the earth.  The Betty SHOOTS out the airlock and nearly 
smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out 
of a speeding car.

<b>INT.  BETTY
</b>
The Akiriga passes, huge above them

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Look out!

<b>CALL
</b>
I am!

<b>EXT.  THE BETTY
</b>
The ship swerves as Call expertly avoids the Auriga -- and see Ripley 
and the newborn on top, still fighting for purchase

The Betty gets clear, leveling out --

The Auriga still heads straight for earth, as the terrain below becomes 
clear -

- deserted, snow covered mountains

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
Hanging on

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
Fighting to control the Betty

<b>ANGLE:	INSIDE THE AURIGA
</b>
Deserted halls, passageways bodies, and,aliens milling here and there

<b>CALL\SHIP
</b>
Collision in six seconds ... five... four...

(softly)

Here we go...

<b>ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA
</b>
SMASHES INTO THE GROUND, a deafening exposion eating the massive ship 
in seconds, utter cacophony.

<b>ANGLE: THE BETTY
</b>
Flying away, the thundering firestorm behind it.

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
An instrument panel suddenly SPARKS beside her warning lights flash, 
the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence

<b>CALL
</b>
Johner!  Fire!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Vector control's fucked! we gotta put down!

<b>CALL
</b>
Find me a path!

Johner sprays foam on the fire.  There is a loud BANGING heard far 
overhead.

What the fuck is that?

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm.

The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Godamnit!

She looks around at the alien.  It's almost on her.

Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and 
tendrils.  Hissing.

It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on

<b>ANGLE: JOHNER
</b>
Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
It's Ripley!  Ripley's on the fucking hatch!

In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white.

<b>CALL
</b>
Let her in!

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Fuck no!  There's something else out there with her!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
One of them.

Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is. 

Awed fear creeps into his voice: 

<b>JOHNER
</b>
No. it's something else.

Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat.. Vriess fights to control the 
ship as she  climbs up toward the hatch.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Goddamnit, Call!

Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Look at that fucking thing!  We can't open up!

They both tumble as the ship jerks

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY
</b>
Is bucked OFF THE SHIP

before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it --

The newborn SMASHES it against he ship, trying to shake her again -

- she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away.

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence.

<b>ANGLE: VRIESS.
</b>
Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously 
close below.

<b>ANGLE: THE ALIEN
</b>
Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn 
between Ripley and this new distraction --

Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the 
newborn.

The beast makes for the doorway -- and CALL POPS HALFWAY OUT pointing a 
GRENADE LAUNCHER  at the thing.. She BLASTS it once,  the beast roaring 
and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough.  Call fires again but 
the ships rocking sends the shot wild.

she flies back for all of a second

The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her 
in and closes the hatch, the beast just SLAMMING in it as it closes.

<b>INT.  THE BETTY
</b>
Ripley is hanging on Call, exhausted.

Another BANG on the hatch, and they can see the door starting to give.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Call!  NOW!

Call and Ripley head into the cockpit.Johner continues looking at the 
vidscreen at the beast.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
We can't to do a vertical setdown! Braking systems are shot!

<b>CALL
</b>
Find me a patch of land!  I'll put her down.

Call jumps back into the pilot's seat by Vriess.  He pulls up hard on 
the wheel, but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
That thing isn't going anywhere!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Johner, strap in!  We're coming down hard!

ANGLE:     -BETTY  Approaches the rough, wooded terrain, just above the 
trees.  Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down -- bounces back up 
and then down again

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
Fighting the wheel -- she can't pull it up hard enough.

<b>ANGLE: THE BETTY
</b>
The ship blasts through trees.  The newborn moves to the back of the 
ship to avoid debris.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
That things gone back behind the thrusters!

Call and Ripley look at each other.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Hit it.

Call throws on the thrusters, the ship ROCKETS forward   ANGLE: THE 
<b>NEWBOM
</b>
Engulfed in flame, losing its grip --

<b>THE BETTY
</b>
Going too fast -- Call can't control it

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Kill thrust! Now!

Call does.

<b>ANGLE: THE BETTY
</b>
Skids, skids, throwing up enormous debris.  It hits another wooded area

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
is thrown bodily into the windshield --

<b>THE BETTY
</b>
mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt.

As soon as they've recovered, Call throws off her seatbelt.

CALL Is everbody all right-?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Where're you going?

Call opens the hatch.

<b>CALL
</b>
To make sure that thing is really dead

Its giant face LUNGES down at her, piston tongue shooting out.

It has charred black skin -- in some places that skin has fallen off 
and wet pink flesh shows through.

Call drops to the floor, the tongue just missing her.  Johner scrambles 
for his gun as

Ripley drags her out of the way.

AS quickly as it came, the head lurches back out.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
I think it's gone!

<b>VRIESS
</b>
No, it's waiting for us to come out!

Can we fly?

<b>VRIESS
</b>
We can't fucking crawl!

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
It's gone.

Call looks at her.

<b>CALL 
</b>
Are you sure?

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Good!  Great!

<b>CALL
</b>
No...

Call grabs a grenade launcher.

<b>CALL
</b>
I've got to stop it.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Call

<b>CALL
</b>
That thing is thirty minutes old!  In a few hours it'll grow up.  If it 
reaches a place with people...

She heads for the door but Ripley is on her way.  They exchange a look.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
You'll never catch it.

Call tosses her the grenade launcher.

<b>CUT TO: EXT.  BETTY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow.

Ripley comes out the top.  She looks around her, sees the tracks in the 
snow.

Huge, loping.  She jumps.down off the ship.

And runs.

Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an 
animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this 
is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see.

She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she 
reaches a cliff face, and looks out on:

<b>A CITY.
</b>
Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's 
just before  the horizon.

The newborn RISES in front of Ripley, STRIKES her before she has a 
chance to aim her weapon.

Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying.

The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by 
an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, FIRE

The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get 
off another shot, it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS, the 
launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the 
ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER, Call at the controls. aiming right  for the 
newborn.

It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head, 
it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning 
out, as Call comes around for another shot.

Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming 
harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last 
second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes 
at her.  KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF --

She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface 
and she takes her hand, SLAMS her fingers into the smooth rock face 
like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase.

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the 
harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse 
but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face 
Call herself.

<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S
</b>
Bloody and torn, it SMASHES into the rockface, as she climbs back to 
the top

<b>ANGLE: THE NEWBORN
</b>
SWINGS the harvester into a tree, Call nearly knocked loose again. The 
monster is jolted as well, lets go, Call pilots the machine back 
through the trees, the alien watching it, growling --

Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads 
back for the beast at TOP SPEED, the wind roars as she closes

The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it, it goes flying, screaming in 
pain,  the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over, CRASHING against 
the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it 
and the ground.

The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly 
pissed.

Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward 
them.

Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine.  Terrified, 
but determined, she reaches for a lever

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
No! Over here!

Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms.

<b>CALL
</b>
Ripley!  Let it come!  Let it come!

Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever. The beast is 
torn, and for a  moment doesn't move.

Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her 
face.

She looks around and spots:

<b>ANGLE: THE GRENADE LAUNCHER
</b>
Halfway between her and the newborn.

For a moment neither of them moves.  Then Ripley RUNS, the newborn 
comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley 
DIVES at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and 
she FIPES!

The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears 
back, screaming -

- Ripley FIRES and FIRES, driving it back toward the upended harvester.

The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls.the trigger.  
There is a hollow click.

Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.  A SSCREAM wells up in 
her throat and she 

THROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and 
sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester.

Call pulls the lever.

In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to 
top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as 
layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes.

And it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically.

Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- 
but the beast grabs her, holds her.  The blades ever closer as she 
struggles with it.

<b>ANGLE: CALL
</b>
Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the 
machine all around her!

She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.  A stream of blood 
lands on her shoulder, eating it away.  Another on her leg, and panic 
blooms, bright in her.

<b>CALL
</b>
<b>RIPLEY!
</b>
Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying 
grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and 
spark, blood eating through the controls.

Call writhes, blood everywhere now.  She is lost in primal terror.

Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood 
splattering her, wrenchs Call free.  She drags her' out.

A section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the 
dying alien.

Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around 
her.

Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, 
breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it 
still.

<b>DISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL
</b>
Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.  Collapsing 
gently on itself.

<b>WIDE ANGLE:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SAME - LATER
</b>
The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames.

Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
The bitch takes her time in burning.

<b>VRIESS
</b>
Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up.

<b>JOHNER
</b>
Troopers should be finding our ship any time now. 1 don't much love the 
idea of being around when they do.

Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city.

Christie offers the bottle to Call.  She takes it and drinks.

VRIESS (to Call)

I guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either.

<b>CALL
</b>
I guess not.

She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together.

<b>VRIESS 
</b>
Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty of places to get lost here.

<b>CALL
</b>
So I've heard.

After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley.  She hands 
her the bottle.

Ripley looks at it.

<b>CALL
</b>
It's a drink.  You drink it.

RIPLEY (smiling) I remember. She drinks.

<b>CALL
</b>
So, what do you think?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Think?

<b>CALL
</b>
What should we do now?

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
I don't know.

She looks out in the distance...

RIPLEY I'm a stranger here myself

The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar 
horizon, as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame.

<b>   
</b>   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
<b>   
</b>   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
</b>             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
<b>   ROBBIE.
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
<b>   
</b>   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
<b>   
</b>   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
<b>   
</b>   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
<b>   
</b>   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
<b>

             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell punches up the volume.
<b>   
</b>   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.

</b>             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.

</b>   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates

<b>   
</b>   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,

<b>   
</b>   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;

</b>   Melanie looks at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
   and gets the phone.

   Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
   building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
<b>   
</b>   An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
   can be heard.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
   back."

<b>   
</b>   The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
   regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind

</b>   Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
   motions for Ordell to take a seat.

</b>   Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
<b>   
</b>   He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.
<b>   
</b>   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
   rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.

</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b>   Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
   bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.

             arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
                   (pause)
             That's all I have. I believe it's a
             surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.

             point at it and push the button.
             You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
             means the alarm's off and the doors

</b><b>   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
</b><b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             What's the problem?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.

</b>             Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk

<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             I ain't doin' you no way. I just
             ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
             problem with small places.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, my ass has got a problem
             spending ten thousand dollars of my
             own goddam money to get ungrateful,
             peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
             do it -
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             Look, man, I know I owe you -
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             - Well, if you owe me, git your ass
             in the trunk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
             be locked in the trunk of no car.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You think I wanted to spend ten
             thousand dollars on your ass?
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont starts to speak -
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Answer the question, nigga. Do you
             think I wanted to spend the thousand
             dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             Course you didn't.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             But the only way to help you was to
             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
             how 'bout this? After we're through
             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
             My treat.
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
             smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
             side of red beans and rice.
             Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;

</b><b>   TRUNK
</b><b>   
</b>   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
<b>   
</b>   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
<b>   
</b>   Cool, old-school R&amp;B fills the cab.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
<b>   
</b>   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
<b>   
</b>   ... then stops.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
<b>   
</b>   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
<b>   
</b>   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
<b>   
</b>   The cab goes black.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Don't worry. It's just me.
<b>   
</b>   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&amp;B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell drives the Olds away.

             from some black show on Jay Leno. I
             watched that for a bit, but I kept
             flippin channels cause I didn't know

             into that roach motel and get
             uncomfortable. You bring your ass out

</b>   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back

             all the way. You go in looking for a
             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're
             different, me and you. Cause me, once
             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
             get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.

</b>   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell closes the trunk.

<b>

                   (taking out a Viceroy and
                   lighting it up)
             And if you know Beaumont, you know

</b>             Can I be of some assistance?
<b>   
</b>   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her

</b>             I doubt it.

             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.

             You could get a two hundred and fifty
             thousand dollar fine, plus two years
             in prison. Now you want to talk to us
             about it, or you want to talk to
             Customs?

</b>             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like
             them, or a couple good-hearted guys

<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             We could, smart ass... or we could
             work out what's known as a
             Substantial Assistance Agreement.
             That is if you're willing to
             cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
             money and who you're giving it to.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.)
</b>             You got a good lawyer?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             Can she afford a good one is the
             question. Otherwise she'll be in
             Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
             the Public Defender gets around to
             her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.)
</b>             Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
             Livingston?
<b>   
</b>   Not a word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
             'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in
             the chest.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
<b>   
</b>   Not a word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             If you don't want to talk to us, I
             guess we'll just have to hand you
             over to Customs.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie puts out her cigarette.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Okay, let's go.
<b>   
</b>   She stares down the cops.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DARGUS AND NICOLET
</b><b>   
</b>   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not a loser.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet joins back in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Help yourself.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
<b>   
</b>   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             My pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             What's in it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Beauty products.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I'll count the money.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             What's this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's my diet shit.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Let's see what else is in there.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Oh, Miss Brown?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             And what would this be, Sweet and
             Low?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What the fuck is that shit?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I know what it looks like.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You planted that shit on me.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Look, that shit ain't mine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>                   (to Dargus)
             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'

<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
             have a seat and tell us who might
             know something about this fuckin'

</b>             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the

</b>             Oh, yeah? What did he do?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (O.S.)
</b>             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             The bond for possession is only a
             thousand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
             it Possession with Intent. A black
             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit
             happened to a movie star. It's
             Possession.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It still sounds high.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
             all.

             with that where-there's-smoke-there's
             fire logic. They roust my ass outta
             bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
             Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
             to death. She thought they were gonna

             She's my friend. When my friends get

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Beaumont worked for you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             That's what the police thought. I
             told them I'm unemployed, how could I
             have anybody work for me? Now I bail
             out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
             police on me again, huh? Wanting to
             know was she doing things for me, was
             she bringing me that money!
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Was she?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             If there's no - what do you call it -
             confidentiality between us? Why would
             I tell you anything?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
<b>

             shit -
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             - I'm telling you what I have to do.
             What you have to do, in case you
             forgot, is come up with premium of a
             thousand bucks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If I don't see it in front of me,
             you're right. It ain't shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
             don't have a tab.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Falsely accused? She didn't come back
             from Mexico with cocaine on her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Okay, man. I got your money. But

<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
   the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
   join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
   return.
<b>   
</b>   The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
   dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
   Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
   lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
<b>   
</b>   The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
   and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
   years before it became a black bar.

<b>   
</b>   Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
   a bar candle in a red glass thing.

</b>   Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
   white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
   Max.

             They're hard to find here. I was
             locked up with the last two getting
             legal advice from a woman who was in
             for bustin' her boyfriend's head open

                   (she takes a sip of wine)
             I don't know - I guess what I need is
             a lawyer, find out what my options

             I've written something like' fifteen
             thousand bonds since I've been in the
             business. I'd say about eighty

</b>             So far I've been told I can cooperate
             and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
             stand mute and get as much as five
             years. Does that sound right?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b>             Yeah, but that's not what this was
             about. They were fuckin waitin' for
             my ass. They knew I had that money,
             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b>             I had 'em too. I burnt those two
             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.

</b>             Who gave me the money and who I was
             giving it to. And some guy they found
             in a trunk with his head blown off.
             Said it was him who told them 'bout
             me.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
             hell bonding out of federal court. He
             doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
             you to tell him what you know. He
             uses you to get a line on Ordell,
             make a case, then take him federal.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             How many trips did you make?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             With ten thousand? Nine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He's got that kinda money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Cash poor?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets exasperated.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.

   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture

   off.

</b>   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
<b>   
</b>   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a

             All that money, want to know where
             you got it?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I'magine they asked who you givin' it
             to, too.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They asked.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And what was your answer?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie says to his face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're not asking the right
             questions.
<b>   
</b>   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Beaumont Livingston.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I knew it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I didn't tell 'em anything.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             My name come up?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b>   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You say anything about me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They told me.
<b>   
</b>   At this moment the film becomes a:
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SPLIT SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX IN CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
<b>   
</b>   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You scared of me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
<b>   
</b>   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hears a CLICK.
<b>   
</b>   Can't believe it.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX IN CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE GLOVE BOX
</b><b>   
</b>   The gun is gone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Where is it?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Is that what I think it is?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What do you think it is?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I think it's a gun pressing against
             my dick.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You thought right... Now take your
             hands from around my throat, nigga.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
<b>   
</b><b>   END OF SPLIT SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
   pushes him against the wall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             What the hell you doin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
<b>   
</b>   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Baby, I ain't come here -
<b>   
</b>   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Go sit over in that chair.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sits.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Put both hands behind our head.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell does...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This shits gettin silly now...
<b>   
</b>   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   A coffee table lays between them.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I just came here to talk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             - Baby, I didn't -
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, very interested.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got a problem...
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All your money's in Mexico.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               TIME CUT:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DOORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (O.S.)
</b>             Talk to you tomorrow.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell leaves.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE TO BLACK
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   OVER BLACK
</b><b>   
</b>   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE UP ON:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SAME SHOT DORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
<b>   
</b>   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
<b>   
</b>   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
<b>   
</b>   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
<b>   
</b>   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you're having some.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I am. Have a seat.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You get a chance to use it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Black's fine.
<b>   
</b>   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Thanks, but I have my own now.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
<b>   
</b>   She turns off the water.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What, I couldn't hear you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
<b>   
</b>   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's just say I got one, okay?
<b>   
</b>   She turns on the coffeemaker.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Somebody loan it to you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
<b>   
</b>   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Want to hear some music?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It looks nice.
<b>   
</b>   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
<b>   
</b>   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't buy new stuff that often.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
<b>   
</b>   Max listens to the soul song.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             This is pretty.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The Delfonics.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b>             I called in sick this morning. As far
             as the airline knows, I'm still
             available.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Are you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.

</b>             He called you?

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We talked.

</b>   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.

</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
<b>   
</b>   She pours the coffee.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.

             somebody.

             doin' that probation thing again.

</b>             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

</b>             You know, I can't really feel too
             sorry for you in that department.

</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             In fact, I'd make a bet that except
             possibly for an Afro - you look
             exactly the same as you did at twenty
             nine.

</b>             I just feel like I'm always starting
             over. You said how many bonds you

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.

</b>             Not if your ambition is to get high
             and watch TV.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie and Louis laugh.
<b>   
</b>   The phone rings.

                   phone - to Melanie)
             Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
<b>   
</b>   He picks it up.
<b>

<b>   
</b>   No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
<b>   
</b>   Louis smiles to himself.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's on the phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

             somewhere. But you gotta make sure
             they ain't followin' you...
<b>   
</b>   Louis has the bong in front of him.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. COCKATOO INN
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
   both sides.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The Cockatoo Inn.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
             Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
             brick...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Oh, wait, you mean that place that
             has the big sign with a rooster on
             it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a cockatoo.
<b>   
</b>   Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You okay?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
             smoke or laugh now it seems without
             coughing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hangs up the phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>                   (to Louis)
             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
<b>   
</b>   Louis with a smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Way ahead of you.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
<b>   
</b>   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Hope you don't mind keeping him
             company.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             No problem.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
             they're new.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
             hang with Mel.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
   around and looks at Louis.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Want a Metrix?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             What's a Metrix?
<b>   
</b>   She crosses to the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             It's like this major meal in a shake
             you drink instead of having a big
             meal.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             It's a diet thing?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No thanks.
<b>   
</b>   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
<b>   
</b>   He looks around and spots something interesting.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
</b><b>   
</b>   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
<b>   
</b>   Louis picks up the photo frame.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             How old were you here?
<b>   
</b>   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Fourteen.
<b>   
</b>   Louis walks over.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I was pretty much the same height now

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.
<b>   
</b>   She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
   till she hits Stop!
<b>   
</b>   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             That was taken at a place called

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>

</b>             You been to Japan?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I lived there for about nine months.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You lived in Japan, when?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             About five years ago.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Must of made quite an impression.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MEALINE
</b>             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That sounds like a problem.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.
<b>

   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
<b>

             help them. Which is what I have to
             appear to be doing. So I give them
             something they already know. You.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I told them you got a half a million
             dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
             bring it here.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell freaks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You told them that?

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They know I'm delivering for you. I
             mention the half-million - they don't
             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.

<b>   
</b>   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
<b>   
</b>   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANI
</b>             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
<b>   
</b>   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             He seems to be making out.
<b>   
</b>   Referring to the bong.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Is it dead?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b>   She starts preparing a bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
<b>   
</b>   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then

<b>

</b>             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's not what I'm saying at all.
             (pause) You know where he went?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             He went to meet that stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Does that bother you?
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

             tell you about that half-million

</b>             Course he did, he tells everybody

             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b><b>                       MELANIE

</b>   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKI
</b>             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             That's a good idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Who?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know. One of your friends.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             A woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you want.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, I think a woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             But you don't?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I give it to someone else first.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's the idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So we need two people, two women.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Can you cover that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Managers get ten percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'll give ya ten.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Plus the same deal as before.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I can do that.

   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
<b>

   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by

</b>   The international food court, where fast-food versions of

</b><b>   BACK TO ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b>   Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
   Jackie's table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>                   (to himself)
             What's up with this shit.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Does it happen to all men?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And Annette's it for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
<b>   
</b>   With a smile on her face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Who was your girl before Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm old enough to be her father.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             How old's Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I don't care.
<b>   
</b>   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What're you, a bag lady?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I go back to work tomorrow.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You talk them into it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They seem to like the idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Bring the money in and they follow
             it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You don't actually do it that way?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right around here, in the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sit down, leave the bag under the
             table?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie nods her head "yes."
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             Will Ordell go for that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He was here?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I called you last night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You think he's got a thing for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I see.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has he hinted around?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know some interesting people.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
<b>   
</b>   She shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He tries to act cool.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What about you Max?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're avoiding the question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             When did you decide?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.
<b>   
</b><b>   FLASH ON:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   A RELEASE FORM
</b><b>   
</b>   With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
   WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
   her, handing her his business card.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
             bondsman.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The day you got me out of jail?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
             guy. I hear he's staying at this
             house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
             come home.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's
             house?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   FLASH ON
</b><b>   
</b>   Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
   goodbye.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             I dropped you off...
<b>   
</b>   Max finding no gun in his glove box.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             Went to my office, found out you took
             my gun...
<b>   
</b>   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             Got another gun and a stun gun...
<b>

</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             And went to this guy's house in El
             Monte, and I waited for him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What do you do when he comes home?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Shoot him with the stun gun. While
             he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
             'em to County.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You do that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             That's my job.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Did you do it that night?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And is that it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             More or less.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Which one?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you had a chance, unemployed now,
             to walk off with a half-million
             dollars, would you take it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Don't even think about it. You could

</b><b>   INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
   LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
   her.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             We gotta stop meeting this way.

</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY

   flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila

   very different from the first time they met. The three

   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too

   her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
   to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
   older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
   her the ashtray Jackie was using.

             Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
             in the other room is Melanie.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
   sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
   her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
   saying nothin' to nobody.

</b>             You have a nice time, hear?
<b>   
</b>   The door SLAMS behind her.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;

</b>             I don't want no more fuckin'
             surprises. We do this the way I laid
             it out, or we don't do it at all.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b>             Sheronda passin' the money onto
             someone else, that's what the hell
             I'm talkin' 'bout.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b>             I was there, I saw her do it.
<b>

             there.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
             figured you'd try an' pull some shit
             like this.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
             no shit. It's my money, I can do
             whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
<b>

</b>             Not when it's my ass on the line you
             don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
             ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
             was my friend, Simone. She's the one
             gonna be receiving the money, so I
             just wanted her to see how it works.
             She'll be here any minute. Nice
             woman, you'll like her.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
   living room;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Louis, call Simone and tell her to
             get her tail over here. We're waitin'
             on her ass.
<b>   
</b>   Louis gets up to make the call.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
   screwdriver.

</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It washes off. I tell them we're
             doing it the same way as before.
             They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
             idea of leaving her for a fall.

             No answer?

</b>   Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right, the one Simone gives me.
             Simone and I'll make the switch at

<b>

             goes to the dress department with her
             Robinson's/May bag.

</b>             I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
             me. We can't risk switching bags out
             in the open or even in the dining
             area. That's why it has to be a
             woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
             fitting room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So you come out with her
             Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
             Simone peeks out, waits for my man
             Louis here to give her a signal
             nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
             store, gets in her car - mission

</b>   The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa

   "Sally Leroy's."
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different

   monster waves all over the place.
<b>   
</b>   The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BEGINNING OF SHOT
</b><b>   
</b>   The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
   into the place and going up to the bar...
<b>   
</b>   A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
   workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.
<b>

<b>   
</b>   ... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
   MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
   older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
   like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
   As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
   head of hair comes into the f.g....
<b>   
</b>   The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
   on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
   Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.

             "You may leave us now." It's all part

             he saw me. The next trip you're gonna

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right. Everything's the same, except

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
<b>   
</b>   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Do you think they bought it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know, a good cop won't let you
             know he knows you're fulla shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.

             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
             stash where it is, but he wants to
             bring in fifty thousand for bail in
             case he needs it.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He won't - I mean, he didn't the last

             know nothing about it. Like the coke.

</b>   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're

   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
   gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
   So knock it of."

</b><b>   JACKIE'S POV
</b><b>   
</b>   Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
   at Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Free as a bird. I still expect you to
             finish the job, though. How much do
             you have this time?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie starts walking again
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
             pretty sure he's gonna need it for
             bail.

</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
   bag in his lap.
<b>   
</b>   He unzips it.
<b>   
</b>   He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie watches all of this.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             That's fifty thousand, huh? It
             doesn't look like that much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I was told ten thousand in each pack.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             You didn't count it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I never have. It's not my money.
<b>   
</b>   He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
   the folds of a skirt.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             He might have slipped some coke in
             here. Did you check?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie, cool.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
             that again.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
   into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
   to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
   rubber-banded bond packets of loot.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Ever been tempted?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             What? To put one of these in my
             pocket?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             If I did, I'd have to give you one,
             wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
             want. No one knows how much there is
             except us, right?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yes. All those things are true.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             After all, it don't belong to nobody,
             right?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That would be one point of view.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
             that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
             evidence, it belongs to us. You are
             now officially out of trouble. Don't
             do nothing stupid, now.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
             the trouble of pointing it out to
             you.
                   (holding up the money)
             Put this in your shopping bag. It's
             what I expect to find when I look in
             Sheronda's. Comprende?

   the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
<b>   
</b>   Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the

</b>   A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
   comes sliding underneath the stall.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
   books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.

</b>   She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
   and lies it on top of the bag.

<b>   
</b>   We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
   of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
   sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
<b>   
</b>   Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.

</b>   As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction

   main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
   Jackie is completely gone.
<b>   
</b>   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
   she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
   tears.
<b>   
</b>   As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;

</b>   The CAMERA stops twirling.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come

   a natural-born smart ass to change.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I'll be over here. You're too
             conspicuous.
<b>   
</b>   Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
   inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
   him.
<b>   
</b>   He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
<b>   
</b>   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX CHERRY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
<b>   
</b>   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
<b>   
</b>   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
<b>   
</b>   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
<b>   
</b>   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             What are you doin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I'm getting out of here. What do you
             think?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Lemme have the bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Fuck you. I can carry it.
<b>   
</b>   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
             fuckin' bag?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Gimme that bag before I knock you out
             and take it.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
             wrong with you?
<b>   
</b>   He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
   them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I'm carrying it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
<b>   
</b>   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Fuck you with your chill pill.
<b>   
</b>   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Remember where we came in?
<b>   
</b>   Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>                   (like a teacher on Romper
                   Room)
             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
             in through Bullocks. I know where it
             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
<b>   
</b>   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
   smirk, follows behind.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie follows close behind.
<b>   
</b>   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
<b>   
</b>   Louis doesn't answer.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Jesus, but if you two aren't the
             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
<b>   
</b>   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah, down the end.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b>   They walk it; it's not it.
<b>   
</b>   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Is it this aisle or the next one
             over?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             This one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b>   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
             telling you, keep your mouth shut.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, Lou-is.
<b>   
</b>   That did it!
<b>   
</b>   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
<b>   
</b>   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
<b>   
</b>   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
<b>   
</b>   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
<b>   
</b>   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
<b>   
</b>   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
<b>   
</b>   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Hey, look. I found it!
<b>   
</b>   He drives away.

</b><b>                                               CUT TO:

</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   "TIME: 4:04"
</b><b>   
</b>   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
<b>   
</b>   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Can I show you something?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks, I won't.
<b>   
</b>   She goes off.
<b>   
</b>   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>                   (low)
             And away we go.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
<b>   
</b>   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
<b>   
</b>   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
<b>   
</b>   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues his fake browsing.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
<b>   
</b>   She and Louis disappear.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
<b>   
</b>   She's gone.
<b>   
</b>   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
<b>   
</b>   It's Max's turn.
<b>   
</b>   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
<b>   
</b>   Max takes a few moments...
<b>   
</b>   ... then walks over to Amy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
<b>   
</b>   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Got 'em, thanks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Sure thing.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
<b>   
</b>   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
<b>   
</b>   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.

<b>

</b>             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.

</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, if you had to do it, you had to
             do it. What we don't want is that
             bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
             that woman.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
<b>   
</b>   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.

             No - I did wonder what he was doing
             there, but didn't think it had
             anything to do with us. You know like
             maybe he was there with his wife or

<b>   
</b>   Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
   staring at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
   Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.

</b>   This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.

</b>             You didn't. I would think with all

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
             with fifty thousand, and go home.

             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my

             that's where you were last time, but
             you weren't there. How the hell else
             am I supposed to let anybody know

             to do that, did you? I knew I was

             dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
             lost Ordell.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I thought you were watching him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend
             shot him twice at point blank range.

</b>             We pick up Ordell. We've got three
             murders we can link him to. We have
             the storage unit where he keeps his
             guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
             warrant to go in and get him. And we
             have you.

</b>             Do you think I took some of that
             money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I have no evidence of your taking
             anything. You didn't pay for your
             snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
             was glad to see that. You've been
             helping us out, you gave us Melanie
             and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
             marked bills stuffed in her shorts
             when they found her, which goes a
             long way backing up your story.

</b>             If you have something else going on
             you haven't told me about, it's
             between you and Ordell. All I gotta
             say is, you better hope we find him
             before he finds you.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
             already tried to get Jackie to go in
             with her, split the half million
             amongst themselves. What she did was
             take quite a risk to see you get your
             money.

             shot before she can tell you what
             happened.

</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b><b>                       MAX

             She won't leave there till you have

<b>

</b>             If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
             in custody right now. When you said
             you'd name her as an accessory she

             I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
             knew how to handle her. She was my

             given her a punch in the mouth, he

</b><b>   
</b>   Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her

</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
   in his pants.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Get ahead of me and open the door.
<b>   
</b>   Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and

<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
             in the goddamn dark for?
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
   bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
   Then Jackie says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Mark...
                   (raising her voice)
             ... he's got a gun!
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
   Beretta in his pants...
<b>   
</b>   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
<b>   
</b>   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
<b>   
</b>   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             He's dead.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             In his inside coat pocket.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks at Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus looks up at Max;
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Why were you with him?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I went to give him his refund, so he
             wouldn't have to come here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             How'd you know where he was?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b><b>                       DARGUS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I told Jackie, and Jackie said you

   at him across the black Mercedes.

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

<b>               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

</b>
               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

</b>                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

</b>                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET
</b>
               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

<b>               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH
</b>
               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

<b>               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY
</b>
               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

<b>               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH
</b>
               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP
</b>
               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET
</b>
               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

<b>               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT
</b>
               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
<b>               SCHOOLGIRLS.
</b>
               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

<b>               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a

                         Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a 
                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by 
                         definition only partially frozen.

                         autonomic functions were shut down, 
                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                         have an affair.  He admitted it, and

</b>                         People have to tell me these things.  
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         throw me a bone here.
                              (pausing)
                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               There is another uncomfortable silence.

               feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I

<b>               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&amp;emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too

               Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

</b>                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&amp;emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

The Union boy falls, releasing               the gun. Jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc, bashing               another soldier in the jaw, and then spins it effortlessly               into his opposite hand and FIRES it point blank into another               Union soldier.

With the other man still gripping the               weapon, Jesse FANS THE HAMMER as he turns, shooting six more               Union soldiers as they try to rush him.

Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the               Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's               cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure               jumps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest!               Jesse gasps, then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has               lodged right in the "X" of the ammo belts on his chest,               stopped by the bullets and leather. Jesse kicks. As the               Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smoothly snap-kicks to               his feet and draws both remaining Colts. He pulls up short.               It's a fifteen year old boy, Web Mimms in a blue uniform.               There's a deadly pause.

JESSE                         Distracting enough for you?                                     FRANK                         Pff. They hardly even noticed you.                                     JESSE                         So you're saying I could have done                         more to attract their attention.                                     FRANK                         Mm-hmm.                                     JESSE                         Such as?                                     FRANK                         You could have worn one of those                         big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday                         hats.                                     JESSE                         That would have made an impression.                                     FRANK                         I figure.                                     JESSE                         See, that's your problem, Frank. By                         the time you finish figuring out                         stuff, I'm already finished doing it.                                     FRANK                         No, Jesse, your problem is you're                         always doing stuff before I'm                         finished figuring it out.               Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP on their recovered               horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a bear hug.                                     COLE                         Wait'll we get back to Missouri,                         start telling those gals about how                         little Jesse James charged the whole                         Union Army by himself!                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You ride like a Comanche.                                     BOB                         You can ride like that?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I said like a Comanche, not this                         Comanche.               Cole mounts up, reaches down a hand to Jesse.                                     COLE                         Ride with me, cousin?                                     JESSE                         I could use the walk.                                     COLE                         Suit yourself. We'll have some                         horses waiting for you at the road.                              (then)                         Let's ride, Rangers!               Cole slaps leather and the Rangers canter off. As they               disappear we hear:                                     BOB                              (low)                         Now, I would just sound stupid                         saying something like that...               Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walking again.                                     JESSE                              (finally)                         Web's dead.                                     FRANK                         I reckoned.                                     JESSE                         Hell of a war.                                     FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a good idea                         at the time.               EXT. ROAD - DUSK               The James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers               ride down a dirt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate               soldiers. The grey uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight.               The men are obviously broken, dispirited. The column               stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye               can see.               Jesse and the other Rangers ride into the midst of the               Confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a               slow-moving river.               For a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie               procession glides past.                                     COLE                         Where you boys going?                                     JESSE                         There's Yankees back there. Lot's                         of 'em.               One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody               sling, looks up at Jesse.                                     VETERAN                         War's over, son. General Lee                         surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.               The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into the middle               distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face.                                     FRANK                         Yesterday.                                     BOB                         Well, somebody better go tell THE                         DAMN YANKEES!                                     COLE                         What do we do now?               Jesse seems to be the only one with a clear head.                                     JESSE                         Home. We go home. We ride like hell                         to get there, and we kill anything                         or anyone that comes between us and                         our homes. And when we get there we                         stay there and God help any fool who                         tries to get me to leave my farm                         again.                                     BOB                              (pause)                         Best damn plan I heard all war.               Jesse jerks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of               the Missouri Rangers trot off into the sunset.               MONTAGE               -- Jesse, Frank, the Youngers and Comanche Tom riding hard               down country roads, past burned out farms.               THE RIDERS               Are struggling through a downpour in a pitch black night,               one of the horses slipping, going down.               BLAZING SUN               On a dusty road, the Youngers sharing a horse now,               everybody just trying to keep moving.               EXT. HILLTOP - DAY               Jesse, Frank, Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom are looking down               on the frontier town of Liberty, Missouri.                                     FRANK                         Hello, Liberty Missoura!                                     JESSE                         All this time in the saddle... We                         get to the farm, I'm going to shoot                         this damn horse just on principle.                                     COLE                         Never thought that pissant town                         would look so pretty.                                     BOB                         Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is                         pretty.                                     JESSE                         Home, boys. Back to our farms.                                     COLE                         Planting corn. Harvesting corn.                         Year after year.

BOB                         Then I love it.               They start to ride down into town.                                     COLE                         Tom, why don't you stop at our                         spread before you head on out to the                         reservation? Figure we might have                         some work for you, if you want.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Hmm. Go back to the reservation and                         get drunk in a dirt shack, or work                         for you...                                     COLE                         Well?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I'm thinking...               Cole throws a playful punch at Comanche Tom.               EXT. LIBERTY STREET - DAY               The gang is riding into the main stretch of town. They're               grinning, happy to be home, until --                                     JESSE                         We got problems.               DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS are walking along the boardwalk,               lingering near the saloon, all suddenly staring at the               riders.                                     COLE                         What the --                                     FRANK                         Must be a garrison in town. We're                         in occupied territory, boys.               Cole is returning stares.                                     JESSE                         Hands off your hip, Cole.                                     COLE                         You're not scared, are you?                                     JESSE                         Pick your fights, cousin. You                         taught me that.                                     BOB                         It gets worse.               There in the center of town, is a brand new scaffold. Three               bodies, fresh ones, are hanging from the nooses.                                     FRANK                         Jesus mercy, that's Charlie                         Higgins, Dave Laller ...                                     BOB                         ...

The riders stop at the scaffold, take off their hats.                                     JESSE                         Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the                         only casualty this town's got.                                     FRANK                         We better go to Doc's, see what's                         going on here.                                     COLE                         I'm cutting them down.               Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Union               Soldiers have started to form a crowd                                     JESSE                         Not now.                                     COLE                         What is wrong with you?                                     JESSE                              (low)                         In case we have to kill these                         sonofabitches, I don't want them to                         see us coming.               Cole thinks, nods. They ride away from the scaffold.                                     BOB                         Cole, I want to get to the farm,                         make sure Little Jim and the girls                         are okay.

MIMMS HOME - DAY               Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white two-story               frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees.               ANOTHER ANGLE               They dismount and walk up to the porch. A FARM HAND in a               cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch.                                     JESSE                         Scuse me, we're here for the Doctor.               The farm hand turns and pulls off his hat -- her hat. She's               a chestnut-haired beauty in her late teens, ZERELDA MIMMS.                                     ZEE                         Jesse! Frank!               She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously,               immediately smitten.                                     JESSE                         Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?                                     ZEE                         You were little Jesse James when                         you left.

As Frank turns Jesse's horse               and leads it away, Jesse's head keeps pivoting, fixed on the               door.

Jesse and Cole, shirtless, are               driving a post into a hole. Frank STEPS OUT of the house and               joins them.

Frank laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse.                                     FRANK                         Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at                         Bunty's...                                     COLE                         Sadie was not a man!                                     JESSE                         She had a moustache.                                     COLE                         She was European!                                     JESSE                         All right, calm down. I'll agree                         Sadie was a woman --               Jesse and Frank swallow their laughs.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         -- if you stop saying things about                         my Zee.                                     FRANK                         Your Zee? Hmm.                              (quoting)                         "From women's eyes this doctrine I                         derive: they sparkle still the right                         Promethean fire; They are the books,                         the arts, the academes, that show,                         contain, and nourish all the world."                                     COLE                         I have no idea what you just said,                         but it sounded real nice.                                     FRANK                         Shakespeare.                              (pause)                         He's European.                                     COLE                         Ah.                                     JESSE                         You want to write that down for me                         so I can say it to Zee?               The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and               Cole shrug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Thanks for the help.                                     COLE                         After all you did on our farm?                              (sips, then)                         You miss it, don't you Jesse?                                     JESSE                         The war? What, are you crazy?                              (beat)                         There are things I miss about it.                                     COLE                         It was exciting.                                     JESSE                         But it was a whole lot of killing.                         Why should we miss that?                                     COLE                         Because we were good at it?  Hell,                         we were great at it. Jesse, don't                         tell anyone I said this, because                         everybody knows I'm the toughest man                         in this town, but you are one                         terrifying sonofabitch with those                         guns.                                     JESSE                              (regretful, but not)                         Yeah.               Frank looks at Jesse thoughtfully. Then all three notice               ANGLE ON               A BUGGY that stops at the edge of the property. Ma STEPS               OUT onto the porch next to Frank to meet:               A man in a suit, ROLLIN PARKER, and three riders who               dismount and flank Parker: two DETECTIVES and a big Scot               with a beard and no moustache, ALAN PINKERTON. Pinkerton is               wearing a suit and a gun in a high waistband. All four               advance to the house.                                     PARKER                         Howdy, folks. How are you this                         afternoon?                                     COLE                         "Howdy"?                                     JESSE                         Easterners.                                     MA                         We're just fine, thank you, sir.                                     PARKER                         I am Rollin H. Parker, personal                         emissary of Mr. Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad. These two                         gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives,                         working for Mr. Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad, and this gentleman                         here is the famous Alan Pinkerton,                         founder of the Secret Service and                         now working under contract to Mr.                         Thaddeus Rains.                                     JESSE                         Would that be Thaddeus Rains,                         president of the Rock Island and                         Pacific Railroad?                                     FRANK                         You know him?                                     JESSE                         Heard of him.                                     PARKER                              (trying to regain                              control)                         As you have no doubt heard from                         your neighbors, our railroad is                         moving west.                                     JESSE                         That makes sense, as east would put                         you underwater.               Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and               continues.                                     PARKER                         ... moving west, opening the                         frontier for folks such as yourself.                         Your acreage here is on the proposed                         right of way.               Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes it.                                     PARKER  (CONT'D)                         I'm here for your signature on this                         land sales contract. I'm authorized                         to pay you two dollars an acre.                                     MA                         Two dollars?                                     PARKER                         That's right. That's the price                         authorized by the railroad's board,                         and approved by the Department of                         the Interior of the Government of                         the United States of America.                                     MA                         This land ain't for sale.               Pinkerton steps forward.                                     PINKERTON                         Ma'am, I can understand how you                         might feel that way -- you've made a                         lovely home here. But it's really                         not up to me or you. Are you                         familiar with the legal concept of                         the Right of Eminent Domain?                                     FRANK                         Yeah, I am. What about it?               Parker is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in               these farmers.                                     PINKERTON                         Well, this land is about to be                         condemned.                                     PARKER                         I'm doing you folks a favor --                                     COLE                         Said the skinner to the mule.                                     PARKER                         -- with a price of two dollars an                         acre for this one time only offer.                         After today the price goes down. So                         if I were you, I'd just sign the                         contract, and I'll be on my way.               Frank takes the contract from Ma and hands it back to               Parker.                                     FRANK                         Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell                         Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where                         the sun don't shine.                              (to the boys)                         Shakespeare.                                     JESSE/COLE                         Ah.               Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest their               hands on their guns.                                     PINKERTON                         I don't think you understand. You                         don't have a choice.               CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn and cocked two Colts               from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his rifle from the               doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but               Pinkerton seems no more than curious.                                     PARKER                              (to Ma)                         Ma'am. You have to look in your                         heart and do what you know is right                         here.                                     MA                         Let me ask the Lord.               Ma bows her head for a moment. She then nods and looks up.                                     MA  (CONT'D)                         The Lord says we can bury 'em out                         back in the orchard, nobody'll ever                         find them.                                     JESSE                         Somebody's in a vengeful smiting                         mood today.                                     FRANK                         Why don't we just let them go for                         today, Ma. We'll bury them out back                         next time.                                     MA                         Oh all right.               Parker, and the detectives are stepping backward to the               buggy.                                     PARKER                         You people are making a serious                         mistake!               Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group.                                     PINKERTON                              (nodding)                         Nicely played.               Parker, Pinkerton and the detectives RIDE OFF. The group at               the James house watches them go, then Cole turns to Jesse.                                     COLE                         Where the hell did you get those                         guns?               OFF JESSE'S SHRUG WE                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT               Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room               school house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is               leading the meeting.                                     FRANK                         I went up to the courthouse and                         looked at the right of way documents                         for the rail bed. The railroad                         doesn't even need our land, they're                         just taking the land on both sides                         for as far as they can.                                     JESSE                         Damn. All that reading paid off.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Floor recognizes Clell Miller.               CLELL MILLER, tall and blond, steps forward.                                     CLELL                         They're saying we don't sell, we                         might end up with nothing!                                     FRANK                         That's only if we don't stick                         together.                                     DOC MIMMS                              (pointing)                         Loni Packwood.               LONI PACKWOOD, a sad, scruffy man stands up.                                     LONI                         I say this is the last straw. I                         came back from the war, I found my                         house burned down. My cows was dead.                         Now my wife's run off with my                         cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch.

LONI                         I forget.                              (almost weeping)                         Took my dog...               Another FARMER steps up.                                     FARMER                         I signed.                                     FRANK                         Harlan, you can't.                                     FARMER                         I'm tired of fighting. I'm just                         gonna take my family and move west.                                     CLELL                         Maybe we should hire a lawyer.                                     FARMER 2                         That's a good idea!                                     FRANK                         It would be, if the courts were on                         the up and up.                                     CLELL                         So what do we do?               ANGLE ON               the school house door as it BANGS open and Bob Younger               STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a cut on his forehead, being               supported by Zee.                                     BOB                         They got Cole.               He collapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him.                                     ZEE                         He came to our house, Daddy. I                         figured you'd all want to hear this.               Jesse and Frank are next to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's               shoulder. He notices.                                     BOB                         They came up, made the same offer                         they made you folks. Our little                         brother Jim tried to chase 'em off,                         one of those detectives hit him in                         the head, knocked him out. Cole lost                         his temper.                                     FRANK                              (rubbing his                              forehead)                         Oh no...                                     BOB                         He just lost his temper a little.                                     JESSE                              (sighing)                         How many of them did he kill?                                     BOB                         Two.                                     FRANK                         Damn!                                     BOB                         They said because the detectives                         were working for the Department of                         the Interior --                                     FRANK                         The Army can hang him.                                     BOB                         Tomorrow.                                     CLELL                         What do we do?                                     JESSE                         Nothing.               The crowd stares at Jesse.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         You folks are going to do nothing.                         You're all going to go home right                         now. So you're going to be able to                         swear on a Bible that you don't know                         anything about what's going to                         happen tomorrow.               Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying. The crowd               quietly begins to disperse.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Boys...                                     JESSE                         Go home, Doc.                              (softly)                         They ain't gonna hang no more                         Liberty boys.               Doc Mimms nods, EXITS.               Jesse walks to the other end of the school house. Bob,               Frank, Clell and Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS               OPEN again and Comanche Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting               six-guns way too big for him.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I couldn't lose him.                                     BOB                         Jim Younger, I told you--                                     JIM                         It's my fault they're gonna hang                         Cole. I want in.                                     FRANK                         Jim, it was just a matter of time                         before they tried to hang somebody                         else to scare off the other farmers.                                     JESSE                         And you're too young.                                     JIM                              (to Jesse)                         I'm the same age you were when you                         went off to war.                                     JESSE                         And the same age Web was. No.                                     ZEE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         You're wasting time.               Zee joins them.                                     JESSE                         Zee, go home.               Zee's eyebrows go up.                                     ZEE                         Who else was there when they hanged                         the others?               The men look at each other. Nothing.                                     ZEE  (CONT'D)                         You need to know how they do it.                         Which way they walk up. What order                         they do things in. And if you mess                         up rescuing Cole because you won't                         listen to a woman, then God damn you                         all.               Pause.                                     JESSE                         All right. Seven of us against a                         Union regiment and Pinkerton                         detectives in broad daylight in the                         middle of Main Street.               Jesse smiles.                                     BOB                         He's smiling.                                     JIM                         Is that bad?                                     FRANK                         Very.               EXT. LIBERTY CITY GALLOWS - THE NEXT DAY               Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bottom of               the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark               rhythm.               Parker is watching this like a sideshow. Pinkerton is next               to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is getting larger               and surlier by the minute.                                     PARKER                         Relax, Alan. The Army has this all                         in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will                         be very pleased with this news.                         Nothing like a hanging to motivate                         the populace to relocate.                                     PINKERTON                         It's not my job to relax. I've put                         men facing out both ways down Main                         Street, so nobody can ride in                         shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up                         on the water tower just in case.               Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. WATER TOWER               We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit, who WAVES BACK and               then kneels and sights down his long rifle. Tucked away               behind him, out of sight from the street, is a               bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. GALLOWS               Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the               stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman.               LONG SHOT               of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on               both sides, guns ready. The position is completely               unassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in               front of him. The noose is placed on his neck.               BACK TO               The gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION               LIEUTENANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his               face. The CROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the               HANGMAN, who grabs the lever --               The drums STOP --               But the drumming doesn't.               The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army men               and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's               definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer...               The CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the               gallows...               The drumming gets LOUDER ...               EXT. STREET               REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the               street, their hooves creating the drumming!               REACTION SHOTS as the Pinkertons and Army men start to               scatter, the cattle surging around them --               EXT. VIEWING STAND               ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pinkerton running for cover,               Pinkerton half-turned to watch the action.                                     PINKERTON                         Brilliant...               Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW his               stare to see --               ANGLE ON               a HORSE in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the               steer, towards the gallows.               THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS HE               DOES -               Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side of the horse,               where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a leg up on               the horse's back and LEAPS --               SLAMMING into the Hangman, bringing him down!               The cattle pass the gallows, revealing that the tight ranks               of the Army and Pinkertons are now spread out --               EXT. GENERAL STORE               SMASH! From the nearby GENERAL STORE, the other masked               rescuers CRASH through the big front window on horseback and               ride into the Army men, FIRING AWAY.               TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the               gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the               Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as               Frank opens fire.               Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives and               remaining soldiers are completely disoriented.               EXT. GALLOWS               Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from Cole's               neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists --               Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster,               spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing               the stairs behind Jesse's back.  Jesse and Cole exchange a               look, then Jesse steps away --               As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT into the air.               Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by, spins               and starts shooting.               EXT. MAIN STREET               The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse               led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON               and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and               the horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd.               Allen Pinkerton steps past the panicking troops, squarely               in the path of the charging horse. He draws his gun and               FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as the terrified               horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton.               Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the               street. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower.               The soldiers fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the               detectives runs over to the injured Alan Pinkerton.                                     DETECTIVE                         Sir, are you all right?                              (shout)                         Somebody get a doctor!               EXT. MIMMS HOME - NIGHT               WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on.               INT. BEDROOM               Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who lies               unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp.                                     ZEE                         He's going to be fine, right Daddy?                                     DOC MIMMS                         The bullet came out clean, but he                         lost a whole lot of blood. Praying                         wouldn't hurt.               The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside.               INT. LIVING ROOM               Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of               soldiers push in.                                     OFFICER                         Good evening, sir, we're looking                         for a fugitive.                                     DOC MIMMS                         A fugitive? Who?                                     OFFICER                         We don't know, but he was very                         badly wounded. We're checking all                         the houses in the area.               INT. BEDROOM               Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the               stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest               and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her               neck, completely hiding him.               At that moment, the Officer barges in. Zee lets out a               little gasp as if startled awake. She covers herself with               the quilt.                                     ZEE                         Sir! Who are you?                                     OFFICER                         Oh. Sorry ma'am.                                     ZEE                         I should hope so.               The Officer EXITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then               looks down fondly at Jesse.                                     ZEE  (CONT'D)                         Jesse, are you awake?                                     JESSE                              (groggy)                         Mmmm.               Zee gently pushes his hair off his face. Then her               expression changes.                                     ZEE                         Jesse, is that your hand?                                     JESSE                         Nuh-huh ...               Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and               wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters.                                     DOC MIMMS                         They're gone. What are you --                                     ZEE                         I fooled them into thinking I was                         alone.                                     DOC MIMMS                         Well, I hope the boy pulls through.                         We should know in the morning.                                     ZEE                              (with a little smile)                         I think he's already feeling better.               A puzzled Doc Mimms follows her out.               EXT. LIBERTY MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON - TWO WEEKS LATER               A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the               nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue of               Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door.               The DOOR OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an               elegant suit he bought in London last year and a scowl he               picked up in Boston three decades ago. The scowl fits him               better.                                     PARKER                         Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a                         pleasure to have you join us in the                         field.                                     RAINS                         And it is my pleasure to be here.                                     PARKER                         Really!                                     RAINS                         NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have                         to leave my board room to come to                         this godforsaken piece of dirt to                         discover why in the name of all that                         is holy you cannot seem to evict a                         few simple farmers from their                         PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I                         may build the GREATEST railroad that                         this country has ever seen!                                     PARKER                         I can completely understand your                         distress, sir.               Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold, ornate               and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN.                                     RAINS                         Parker, tell me what's going on so                         I can return as quickly as possible                         to Boston and my whores and cigars,                         not necessarily in that order.                                     PARKER                         Two weeks ago, we managed to                         arrange to have the Army hang one of                         the local farmers.                                     RAINS                         Good.                                     PARKER                         Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of                         local thugs managed to rescue him                         from the gallows. Not only has this                         inspired resistance from the other                         farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan                         Pinkerton was seriously injured                         during the incident.                                     RAINS                         Leaving you in charge of operations                         until he recovers.                                     PARKER                              (puffing with pride)                         Yes sir.                                     RAINS                         Just perfect.                                     PARKER                         A further impediment is that the                         Army garrison has been ordered to                         move on from Liberty. We will no                         longer have that particular stick                         with which to threaten the farmers.                                     RAINS                         You see the Army leaving and you                         see the loss of a tool. I see a                         power void to be filled. As we have                         the most power, we may move with                         impunity.                                     PARKER                         I see. I'll get together four                         patrols of our detectives for action                         tonight.                                     RAINS                         I'll teach these podunks what                         happens when they challenge the                         righteousness of progress.               EXT. MIMMS HOME - AFTERNOON - THAT SAME DAY               Zee is on the porch. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving               gingerly. Zee immediately moves to support him.                                     ZEE                         You shouldn't be up.                                     JESSE                         I've been on my back two weeks. I'm                         sick of it.                                     ZEE                         You're sick of my company?                                     JESSE                         No! I mean, of course not. No.                                     ZEE                         Teasing you is completely unfair.                                     JESSE                         What you do to me is unfair. The                         teasing, I mean.                                     ZEE                         I shouldn't tease a hero.                                     JESSE                         What?                                     ZEE                         Everybody in the county knows it                         was you who rescued Cole. We're all                         so proud of you, Jesse. And not a                         single farm's been sold to the                         railroad since. You're everybody's                         hero.                                     JESSE                         I wasn't the only one risking my                         neck that day.                                     ZEE                         So you're saying I should leave you                         alone and go spend time with Jimmy                         Younger?                                     JESSE                         Unfair. You are completely unfair.               They look at each other warmly. Frank DRIVES UP in a               carriage.                                     FRANK                         You ready to stop loafing around                         with this young lady and get back to                         farming?                                     JESSE                         What do you think?                                     FRANK                         Would you get in the carriage?                         Until Ma has you home so she can                         fuss over you herself, she's gonna                         make me miserable.               Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the porch.                                     JESSE                         What do you say, sir?                                     DOC MIMMS                         Go on. You're pretty much all                         healed up.               Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into               the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the               carriage.                                     FRANK                         You're looking a bit more spry now                         that somebody --                                     JESSE                              (to Frank)                         Shut up.                              (to Doc Mimms)                         Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,                         this evening, I could come by?                                     DOC MIMMS                         You know you're welcome any time!                                     JESSE                              (unusually awkward)                         Yesss, but I was thinking, I could                         come by, and then take Zee out. Some                         place near. With other folk. Near.                         Here.                              (beat)                         But out.                                     DOC MIMMS                              (bemused)                         It's fine by me, Jesse.                                     FRANK                         Don't worry, sir, I'll make sure                         they're always properly chaperoned.               Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank.                                     DOC MIMMS                              (grinning)                         Why, that hadn't even occurred to                         me, Frank. I am deeply in your debt.                                     FRANK                         Army's leaving town, so Cole can                         stop hiding up in the woods and come                         back to his farm. Everybody's                         getting together at the Younger                         place for a to-do.               Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF.               EXT. BARNYARD - NIGHT               Dozens of people are milling about happily in the lantern               light of a Western party. Some are dancing to the small               banjo-led band. A small knot of men are comparing war               stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people               clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand.               Jesse -- formally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at               the edge of the light. Immediately the entire group bursts               into applause and crowds Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear               hugs Jesse, making him wince.                                     COLE                         Here's Liberty's favorite son!                              (quietly)                         I'll never forget what you did,                         cousin.                                     BOB                         Zee, I'm pleased you came.                                     ZEE                         Why thank you, Bob.                                     BOB                         I'm especially pleased you came                         with Jesse.                              (off her look)                         Seeing as right now there's a                         gaggle of girls hoping to dance with                         Jesse who are just going to have to                         settle for the many charms of Bob                         Younger.               ANGLE ON               A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women.               Bob runs a hand through his hair.                                     JESSE                         You have no shame.                                     BOB                         Not yet. But I'm hoping.               The party starts up again, and everyone is caught up in the               good times.               ANGLE ON               Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They join in               the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk.               EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT - A WHILE LATER               Jesse, carrying a lantern, and Zee are walking. We can hear               the party still going just a little ways away. They reach a               tree at the hilltop with a beautiful view of the stars and               the river. They sit down, their backs against the tree.                                     JESSE                         I used to come to this tree when I                         was a kid and imagine what my life                         would be like when I got older.                                     ZEE                         You didn't want to farm?                                     JESSE                         I was thinking more along the lines                         of being a river pirate.                                     ZEE                         A river pirate.                                     JESSE                         Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.                                     ZEE                         Thank God you grew out of that.                              (pause)                         You did grow out of that, didn't                         you?                                     JESSE                         Mostly. It would be an all right                         life, for a bachelor.                                     ZEE                         You planning on being a bachelor                         your whole life, Jesse James?                                     JESSE                         Not if I find the right girl.                                     ZEE                         And what's this right girl like?                                     JESSE                         Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes                         me think she's two steps ahead of                         me. And big buck teeth.                                     ZEE                         Where will you find such a girl?                                     JESSE                         Honestly, you'd do if only you had                         the buck teeth.               Zee fakes a monstrous overbite.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (dreamy)                         Finally.               The two move a little closer. Eye contact.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No,                         ah... "From women's eyes this                         doctrine I derive, they sparkle                         still like ... shiny... sparkling                         rocks..."                                     ZEE                         Sparkling rocks?                                     JESSE                         Little ones.                                     ZEE                         Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare                         poems you're trying to quote?                                     JESSE                         Yep.                                     ZEE                         Were you planning on kissing me                         when you finished quoting?                                     JESSE                         I've been planning on kissin' you                         for a very long time.               They kiss. It's everything it should be.               BOOM!               Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and sound.               They turn to look back --               EXT. YOUNGER BARN               The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which               is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger               brothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked               riders disappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at               the riders, but the distance is too great.               Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bob grabs him.                                     COLE                         BASTARDS! Come back here and face                         me!                                     FRANK                         Get buckets!               Some of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well.               Jesse and Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Pinkertons. It's the railroad.                                     JESSE                         Ma.               Frank and Jesse bolt for their horses, swing into the               saddles and GALLOP OFF.               EXT. JAMES HOUSE               From a bit down the road, looking just fine. Jesse and               Frank reign in as relief rushes across their faces --               AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of               matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full               gallop.               EXT. YARD               Jesse and Frank leap from their mounts, trying to get close               to the house. The flames are too strong.                                     JESSE                         Ma! Ma!               Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank               tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him,               still pacing back and forth in front of the inferno.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ma! Please!                                     MA (O.S.) (O.S.)                              (weakly)                         Boys?               The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock. Ma is               stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally               BURNED.                                     FRANK                         Jesus mercy --               They reach her just as she collapses. Jesse is cradling               her, Frank with his arms around both of them.                                     MA                         Riders --                                     JESSE                         We know, Ma. Now we got to get you                         to Doc Mimms.                                     MA                         Take care of each other, boys. You                         say your prayers.               Jesse is openly crying. Frank has tears silently streaming               down his face.                                     JESSE                         Doc Mimms will --                                     MA                         Shush.               Ma's eyes turn up, and she half-smiles.                                     MA  (CONT'D)                         Well look at that. The Good Lord's                         a bit shorter than I reckoned.               Ma gently stops breathing.               ANGLE ON               The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flames of their               home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF RAGE               AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on...                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. JAMES FARM - MORNING               Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoking ruins of their               lives. Other townsfolk are milling nearby, including Zee and               the Youngers.                                     FRANK                         ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make                         a decent life someplace else.                                     JESSE                         Don't care.                                     FRANK                         Didn't think you would.                              (turning away)                         I'm going to go make the coffin.                                     JESSE                         Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't                         be enough by the time I'm through.               Frank is gone.                                     COLE                         Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy                         Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.                                     BOB                         The sheriff says it was a gang of                         drunk Kansas boys.                                     COLE                         I say we ride into town and kill us                         some Pinkertons and railroad men.                                     JIM                         I like that.                                     JESSE                         No.               They stare at him.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         This isn't a feud, this is war.                         They've got more men than we do. We                         kill detectives, they can replace                         'em in a day.                                     COLE                              (snapping)                         So what do we do, General Lee?                                     JESSE                         Just like in the war. Harass their                         supply lines. We kill the railroad's                         men, they won't care.                                     BOB                         But if we take their money and                         supplies...                                     JESSE                         Exactly.                                     JIM                         That's a great plan, Jesse!               Cole nods grudgingly.                                     BOB                         I'll get us a few more men, and                         Comanche Tom'll ride with us.                                     JIM                         Where do we hit first, Jesse?                                     COLE                         I'll pick the first job! I mean...                         I know a girl down at the bank. See                         if she can't get a list of towns                         where the railroad keeps its money.                                     JESSE                         Perfect, Cole.                                     COLE                         Let's ride.               The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house,               pulls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open,               reaches in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind               him in what remains of the doorway.                                     ZEE                         I am so sorry, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         Frank and me have to go away for a                         while.               Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's.                                     ZEE                         You and I, we've started...                         something, you know?

JESSE                         Me neither.

When I've brought them                         to ashes.               Jesse kisses her gently, turns and walks to where the               Youngers are standing. Zee can barely conceal her anger and               heartbreak.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. FIDELITY BANK AND TRUST - DAY               ESTABLISHING SHOT of a Midwestern bank on a quiet street.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               There are two teller windows, a couple of male customers               and a MOTHER and CHILD.               Jesse and Cole ENTER dressed for the trail, longrider coats               and spurs. Saddlebags are slung over their shoulders.                                     JESSE                         Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,                         but I have bad news. The railroad                         payroll has been stolen.               The BANK MANAGER steps out from behind his desk.                                     MANAGER                         What are you talking about? The                         railroad's money is right over there                         in that safe.               Jesse draws two guns, Cole produces a shotgun from his coat.                                     JESSE                         That safe?

FIDELITY BANK               Frank James, Bob and Jim Younger, Clell Miller, Loni               Packwood, Comanche Tom and several new GANG MEMBERS wait               along both sides of the street in this medium sized               mid-western town. Some are standing next to their horses,               some mounted.               ANOTHER ANGLE               An OLD MAN with a cane is walking shakily towards the bank.               Frank jerks his head and Jim intercepts him.                                     JIM                         Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed                         today.                                     OLD MAN                         Wha?                                     JIM                         Bank holiday! Bank's closed!               Jim tries to steer the old man away. The old man starts               batting at him with the cane.                                     OLD MAN                         Get off me!                                     JIM                         Ow! Ow!               Frank sighs.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               Jesse and the Bank Manager are having a staredown.                                     MANAGER                         This is outrageous. Who are you                         people?                                     JESSE                         The James Gang.

FIDELITY BANK               The old man is still smacking Jim with the cane. Bob               crosses to help.                                     BOB                         Sir, it's a bank holiday --               SMACK SMACK and now the old man's laying the cane on both               Bob and Jim.                                     JIM                         Ow!                                     BOB                         Ow ow!               Frank hangs his head.               INT. FIDELITY BANK               Cole turns to the Woman and Child.                                     COLE                         Ma'am, kindly cover that child's                         eyes.                                     WOMAN                         Why?                                     COLE                         I don't want her to see me shoot                         this man.               The woman covers the child's eyes. Cole raises the shotgun.               Jesse half covers his eyes and turns his head. The Manager               swallows.               EXT. FIDELITY BANK               Comanche Tom walks over to where the old man is still               SMACKING Jim and Bob.                                     OLD MAN                         I know it ain't no durned bank                         holiday!

COMANCHE TOM                         On account of we're robbing it.                                     OLD MAN                         Oh. Why didn't you just say so?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         It's a secret.                                     OLD MAN                         Fine. I'll just wait here.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I'd appreciate that.               The old man settles against the wall. Comanche Tom moves               back to his horse. Bob and Jim walk off, glaring at the old               man.               INT. SHERRIFF'S OFFICE               A lean, middle-aged SHERRIFF is walking by his window. His               DEPUTY is whittling at the desk. The Sherriff pulls up short.                                     SHERRIFF                         What the --                                     DEPUTY                         What is it?                                     SHERRIFF                         Old Man Tucker is just standing                         quiet outside the bank.                                     DEPUTY                         So?                                     SHERRIFF                         When have you ever known Old Man                         Tucker not to be yelling at                         everybody?               He takes in the group of riders, reaches for his rifle.               EXT. FIDELITY BANK               Jesse and Cole RUN FROM the bank with full saddlebags.               Everybody MOUNTS UP and starts riding down main street.                                     FRANK                         How'd it go in there?                                     JESSE                         Fine. How'd it go out here?                                     FRANK                         We're gonna have to talk...               BANG! The gang flinches as a chunk of wood splinters from a               post. They turn to see the Sherriff running out in front of               them, raising his rifle --               The entire Gang draws their guns. Jesse raises a hand.                                     JESSE                         Sir, you can do this the smart way,                         or the stupid way. Only one way ends                         with you still breathin'.               The Sherriff takes in the Gang's firepower. He lowers the               rifle.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (to the Gang)                         Just 'cause we're robbing a bank,                         no reason not to be civil about it.               The Gang turns and RIDES OFF hard.               The DEPUTY walks up to the Sherriff a beat later.                                     SHERRIFF                         Where the hell were you?                                     DEPUTY                         I had you covered.

DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT               A bonfire burns in the middle of a rough camp in the woods.               The Gang members are sitting around, relaxing and drinking               coffee. All eyes are on Jesse and Cole as they finish               counting the money.                                     JESSE                         I got seven thousand.                                     COLE                         I got three.                                     BOB                         Ten thousand dollars! That's almost                         a thousand apiece!               The men HOOT AND HOLLER.                                     LONI                         My luck is changing at last!               Cole holds up a pile of papers.                                     COLE                         These are deeds and mortgages of                         farms the bank was holding for the                         railroad.                                     BOB                         Better pass them over here before                         something happens to 'em.               Cole goes to hand the papers to Bob and "accidentally"               drops them in the fire. The men CHEER again.                                     JESSE                         All right, settle down. All this                         money ain't ours.                                     BOB                         Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's.                         That's why we had to go to all that                         trouble of stealing it.                              (to Frank)                         You explain it to him.                                     JESSE                         We oughta take some of this, give                         it to our neighbors in Liberty.

CLELL                         None of them risked their necks for                         this.                                     FRANK                         Now, let's think about this. We                         create some good will with the folks                         hereabouts, make it easier to dodge                         the law.                                     JESSE                         See, Frank's being smart about this.                                     COLE                         Just because he reads all those                         books and knows all those big words                         doesn't make him smart.                                     BOB                         Uhh, yeah it does.                                     COLE                         You stay out of this, Bob.                                     JIM                         I think Jesse's got a good idea --                                     COLE                         You stay out of this too, Jim.                              (to Jesse)                         Who put you in charge of this gang,                         anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine                         leading us during the War.                                     JESSE                         And I planned getting you off the                         hangman's deck --                                     FRANK                         And that's why you both lead the                         gang. Two of you went into that bank                         together, right?               Jesse and Cole nod, still watching each other.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Two heads are better than one. All                         Jesse was doing was making a                         suggestion.               Jesse nods, his face giving nothing up.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         So we're waiting to hear what you                         think of the suggestion. As the                         other leader of the gang.               Cole considers this.                                     COLE                         I reckon it's the smart thing to do.               The other Gang members grumble. Cole whirls on them.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         Hey! We decide something, that's                         it! We're in this for the long haul,                         and this idea of me and Jesse's will                         help give us more places to hide out                         without worrying about some farmer                         with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in                         our sleep. We've got to think --                                     FRANK                         Strategically.                                     COLE                         -- Exactly.

Then               a smile spreads across Clell's face.                                     CLELL  (CONT'D)                         Nobody paid me no thousand dollars                         to fight in the War!               The Gang LAUGHS, and the tension is broken. Jesse and Cole               slap each other's shoulders, and everyone starts counting               their money and talking all at once.               INT. SALOON - DAY               The crowded saloon is alive with music, card-playing, and               dancing girls. Various James Gang members are playing cards               and drinking. Jesse, Cole, and Frank are at the bar.                                     COLE                         It's not a bank.                                     JESSE                         It's better. It's a construction                         depot. They'll have the strongbox                         and some ammo and explosives for us                         to take. That way we can take on a                         bigger job.                                     FRANK                         And it's guarded by Pinkerton                         detectives.                                     JESSE                         And I do so want to shoot some                         Pinkerton detectives.               Jesse and Cole grin and slap each other on the back. Jim               BURSTS in waving a newspaper. He quickly runs to the bar.

ANGLE ON               The TRAIN TRACKS as the James-Younger Gang rides at full               gallop.

THAXTON SWITCH DEPOT - MORNING               The entire work camp is DESTROYED. SMOKE still hangs over               the twisted wreckage, a few wagons smolder, it looks like               Omaha Beach at D-DAY plus 20.  Thaddeus Rains is surveying               the damage with Parker.

The SOUND OF HORSES makes them turn.               ANGLE ON               A fancy carriage that pulls up. WE SEE the ground beneath               the carriage. A boot hits the ground. Then another. Then the               tip of a cane.               REVEAL Alan Pinkerton now moving toward Rains and Parker,               limping from when Jesse's horse trampled him.

We're                         beginning an interesting game here,                         Mr. Rains.

ENGINEER  (CONT'D)                              (reading)                         "Better... slow... down...                         dynamite... ahead... too late...                         you're dead!"               The engineer and the fireman look up. Ahead of them on the               track is an overloaded wagon with barrels marked "TNT".               The engineer slams on the brakes. The high pitched scream               of steel on steel sounds out over the avalanche of sparks               flying from the wheels.               EXT. TRAIN TRACKS               The train stops juuuuust in time. The front of the engine               is inches away from the wagon.               INT. ENGINE               Jesse sticks his head in, guns drawn.                                     JESSE                         That was a fine piece of driving,                         yes sir.               He looks at the wagon. The engineer and fireman follow his               gaze.               EXT. TRAIN TRACKS               Comanche Tom and Jim Younger climb on top of the wagon,               kick over some barrels. They're empty, without even a top or               bottom.               INT. ENGINE               Jesse grins as the engineer and fireman hang their heads.               INT. BANK - DAY               Jesse and Frank walk into a large bank dressed in suits.               Just inside the door, Frank notices something odd and               nudges Jesse. It's a "Wanted" poster. "Frank and Jesse               James. $5,000 reward."               They look back and forth at the artist's sketches and each               other. They shake their heads "no."               Jesse walks over to the teller's window. He hands a bill to               the TELLER.                                     JESSE                         Could you change this please?                                     TELLER                              (studying it)                         Sir, this bill is counterfeit!               Jesse draws. Frank whistles and Cole, Bob and Jim burst in.                                     JESSE                         I don't think it's counterfeit. Do                         you mind if I take a look at all                         your real bills to compare?                                     FRANK                         It's the scientific method. It's                         all the rage.               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY               IN a richly paneled conference room, a group of BANKERS,               POLITICIANS and RAILROAD OFFICIALS are gathered around a               large table. On the table is a map with a dozen red markers.               Thaddeus Rains and Alan Pinkerton are studying the map.                                     RAINS                         Senator, can't you do anything?               A Missouri SENATOR shakes his head.                                     SENATOR                         The people see the James-Younger                         Gang as heroes against the Eastern                         businessmen. This is not an area                         where men in suits are much loved.                                     RAINS                         Pinkerton, why can't you get these                         outlaws?                                     PINKERTON                         It's early in the game yet, Mr.                         Rains. Jesse James and I are just                         learning how each other moves,                         feeling out each other's patterns.                                     RAINS                         I'm losing millions of dollars and                         months of time while you play chess                         with these farmers!                                     PINKERTON                         Hardly farmers. I've done some                         checking. All these were in the War.                         These men know sabotage, tactics,                         and have four years of bloody                         fighting experience behind them.                         They are disciplined, well-trained                         and have a charismatic leader. If I                         were to design the perfect outlaw                         band, this gang is what I would                         create.                                     RAINS                         So you can't tell me anything?                                     PINKERTON                         It's going to be a long winter.               Rains pounds the table.               MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS               -- THE GANG On horseback, firing back at a posse.               -- THE GANG RIDES THROUGH A FIELD               Where dozens of sharecroppers are sweating away. They leave               a wake of twenty dollar gold certificates fluttering in the               furrows and hanging in the corn.               -- PINKERTON, LEADING TWENTY DETECTIVES,               RIDING HARD up to a crossroad. With a wave of his hand,               never stopping, he splits one group off to head East, and he               and the others head West.               WALL OF "WANTED" POSTERS               Marked the "James-Younger Gang." The James brothers and               Younger brothers nod at the likenesses, which are getting               better. All except Bob, who stares at his in disbelief. It               looks nothing like him.               Jesse tears down his poster and autographs it for a young               boy.               EXT. OPEN RANGE               The Gang is riding hard. Cole and Jesse look over their               shoulders, nod to each other, and WHISTLE.               The men bring their horses down to an easy pace.                                     JIM                         I never thought that posse was                         gonna give up.                                     FRANK                         They were admirably persistent.                                     COLE                         Jesse, we got to have a word.                                     JESSE                         Sure, cousin.                                     COLE                         All the posters and newspapers are                         calling this bunch the                         "James-Younger Gang."                                     JESSE                         Yep.                                     COLE                         Why aren't we the "Younger-James                         Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger                         brothers and only two James brothers                         here.                                     JIM                         I kinda like the sound of the                         James-Younger Gang.                                     COLE                              (bristling)                         Whose side you on?                                     BOB                         No, Jimmy has a point. The                         Younger-James Gang could be                         confusing.                                     COLE                         How?                                     BOB                         Say we bust into a bank. We yell                         "We're the Younger-James Gang!"                         People are gonna be thinking, "The                         younger James Gang? Is there an                         older James Gang? How come we never                         heard of the older James gang?" So                         people are trying to figure that out                         instead of raising their arms.                                     JESSE                         Can't argue with that.               Cole rolls his eyes.                                     COLE                         I think you boys are missing the                         point here...               They continue to argue as they ride off.                                     JIM                         How about "James-Younger" for the                         bank jobs and "Younger-James" for                         the train robberies?                                     BOB                         See, that's even more confusing,                         people'll think there's two gangs...               EXT. WESTERN STREET - DAY               Comanche Tom RIDES UP to the building marked Marshall's               Office.               A MARSHALL and a dozen PINKERTON DETECTIVES are sitting               around the porch. Tom leaps off his horse.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You 'um big lawman?                                     MARSHALL                         Yeah, Injun. What do you want?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Great Chief of St. Louis send me.

COMANCHE TOM                         Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in                         Carville that badman Jesse James                         riding toward Rising Sun, above                         Great River, near Eagle Rock.                                     MARSHALL                         East? East above the river heading                         for the Eagle Pass?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Ho-yah!               The Marshall turns to his men.                                     MARSHALL                         I want every man in town! We can                         cut off Jesse James before he                         crosses out of my territory! Let's                         go!               The posse quickly mounts up. The Marshall tosses Comanche               Tom a coin.                                     MARSHALL  (CONT'D)                         Go ahead to the saloon. But don't                         get too drunk!                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Me get heap firewater --               The posse RIDES OFF.                                     COMANCHE TOM  (CONT'D)                         -- you cretins.               Comanche Tom flips the coin over his shoulder. From around               the corner THUNDERS the James Gang. They ride up to the               building marked "Bank" right next to the Marshall's office.               The Gang dismounts, runs in.               An improbably short time later, the Gang members run back               out with full saddlebags and mount up. Comanche Tom RIDES               OFF with them.                                     FRANK                         Nice performance, Tom.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I feel dirty.               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MONTHS LATER               The same men in suits and the same map, only now with more               red markers on it.  In the center of the group are Thaddeus               Rains, Rollin Parker and Alan Pinkerton.                                     RAINS                         Pinkerton. It's been eight months.                         I see robberies. I see hold ups. But                         I do not see men on the end of                         nooses.                                     PINKERTON                         All of the James Gang's encounters                         have been with local law enforcement                         who, quite frankly, are no match for                         this group's cunning.                                     PARKER                         What about your detectives? They                         haven't --               Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains               doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that               Alan Pinkerton is a big, violent Scotsman. He never raises               his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to.                                     PINKERTON                              (to Parker)                         First of all: you, shut up.                              (to Rains)                         Now, you've given me a thousand                         miles of railroad to cover. Every                         time the James Gang strikes, we                         shift a hundred detectives to that                         area. But there's just too much open                         land, too many riverbeds to ride,                         caves to hide in. This gang operates                         across four states, often riding a                         hundred miles between jobs.                                     RAINS                         I can't believe this.                                     PINKERTON                         And there are some towns in                         Missouri where James and his men can                         walk openly, as heroes.                                     PARKER                         How can that be?                                     PINKERTON                         They donate money to farmers, to                         churches. Rumor has it they gave the                         sharecroppers of Maddox so much                         money they were able to build a                         school.

PARKER                         We should go burn that school to                         the ground, sir!                                     PINKERTON                              (dryly)                         Yes, that's the way to win the                         locals back to our side.

And if you want                         results, you will let me do my job                         as I see fit. Unless of course,                              (jerking his head at                              Parker)                         You want this fool to saddle up and                         take another run at it?                                     RAINS                         Can't you tell me anything?                                     PINKERTON                         It's going to be a long spring.               MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS               -- THE GANG RIDES ALONGSIDE A PAYROLL COACH, The COACH is               marked with the "Rock Northern Railroad" logo.               Suddenly Pinkerton guards leap up from hiding places in the               coach and start firing! The gang fires back dropping two of               the men.

THE COACH IS STOPPED               Jesse and Frank are pulling the payroll off as the rest of               the Gang keeps their guns on the remaining Pinkertons. Two               dead Pinkertons lie on the ground.                                     JESSE                         See, that's a shame. If people                         would just hand over the money and                         not shoot at us --               Loni looks at something in his hand.                                     BOB                         What's that?                                     LONI                         Lucky Rabbit's foot.

BOB                         I don't think that one's working,                         Loni.               Loni pockets the charm.               -- JESSE, FRANK, AND THE YOUNGER BROTHERS Sit heads bowed               in a small country church as the collection plate is passed.

Poster. The Gang is all there, admiring the new               posters. The likenesses are remarkable -- except for Bob's.               It still looks nothing like him. And we can see Cole is not               pleased at all the attention Jesse's getting.               -- PINKERTON IN THE BOARD ROOM WITH HIS MAP,               Directing his lieutenants on how to cover the territory.               -- THE GANG CAROUSING IN A SALOON.               Jesse is off to one side, writing a letter on fancy               stationery. Frank is coaching him.               AT THE MIMMS HOME,               Doc Mimms hands Zee the envelope we just saw Jesse working               with.

WHITTLY BANK - DAY               Jesse, Cole, Frank, and Bob are in the middle of a               stick-up. All the BANK PATRONS have their hands up.                                     JESSE                         Okay, folks, I think we know how                         this is going to go...                                     BOB                         One false move and I'll blow your                         heads off!               Jesse, Frank, and Cole look at Bob.                                     JESSE                         Beg pardon?                                     BOB                         You heard me, Jesse. You know how                         crazy I get!               Jesse and Cole turn to the HEAD TELLER.                                     JESSE                         'Scuse us.

I'm feeling a little                         left out.                                     JESSE                              (sighing)                         This is about the "Wanted!"                         Posters, isn't it.                                     BOB                         Yes. I am obviously not standing                         out in people's minds at the                         robberies.                                     COLE                              (to Jesse)                         This is your fault for hogging all                         the publicity.                                     JESSE                         Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob                         is an important part of the gang.               Frank arrives.                                     FRANK                         Gents, we are in the middle of                         something here.

Frank, Jesse, and Cole exchange looks. They turn back to               the now puzzled crowd.                                     FRANK                         Pardon the delay, folks, but we had                         to get Mad Bob Younger under control!                                     JESSE                         Bob here'll kill a man for                         sneezing, and he's the best shot in                         the gang.

The crowd MURMURS APPRECIATIVELY.                                     FRANK                         Now, we would like to get back to                         the robbery.                                     HEAD TELLER                         Of course.               The Head Teller starts filling a saddlebag with money. Bob               glares at a few people, then nods at Jesse. Jesse winks back.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. SALOON - NIGHT               The place is alive with song, gambling, and the money the               James Gang is dropping. At one table, Loni Packwood lays               down his poker hand. As the other players moan, he rakes in               the pot.                                     CLELL                         Damn, Loni, you're lucky.                                     LONI                         Luckiest man in the West, now that                         I'm riding with Jesse James!               He raises his lucky rabbit's foot in toast to Jesse, who is               at the bar nursing a bottle of whisky with Frank.               ANGLE ON               Jesse and Frank at the bar.                                     JESSE                         This has been a good year.                                     FRANK                         Jesse, we're outlaws.                                     JESSE                         And we're good at it.                                     FRANK                         It got to you, didn't it. All the                         killing in the war. You need it now.                                     JESSE                         You've killed your fair share of                         men.                                     FRANK                         If I could go back to farming --                                     JESSE                         That's a lie. You could've bought a                         dozen farms with the money we've                         stolen.                                     FRANK                         I can't quit and leave you alone. I                         can't quit until you quit. Ma                         would've wanted it that way.                                     JESSE                         We're doing this for Ma.                                     FRANK                         Maybe it started out that way. But                         now...                                     JESSE                         What do you want me to say, Frank?                         I was killing men when I was                         fifteen. I like getting shot at. I                         like riding out of town with a posse                         at my back. This is a helluva better                         life than farming.                                     FRANK                         A better life than the one you                         could have had with Zee?               Jesse HURLS the whisky bottle against the wall. At the               CRASH the saloon falls silent. Every eye turns to the James               boys. Frank stands up.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         I'll bet you every dollar we've                         stolen that she hasn't read a single                         one of the letters you've sent her.               Jesse is boiling. His hand twitches.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         You going to throw down on me,                         Jesse?               Jesse's jaw is grinding.                                     JESSE                         Don't do this, Frank. You know I                         love you.               Frank nods, embraces his brother. The saloon noise STARTS               UP again. Frank steps away.                                     FRANK                         We're drunk.                                     JESSE                         Oh yeah.                                     FRANK                         Just do me a favor. Think about                         what this is costing everybody. Not                         just the railroad.               Jesse nods and Frank EXITS. Jim Younger, also drunk, steps               up.                                     JIM                         You okay, Jesse?                                     JESSE                         Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky?                         You're too young to be drinking                         whisky.                                     JIM                         Not too young to shoot a man, not                         to young to drink.                                     JESSE                              (jolted)                         I guess so.                                     JIM                         I was always jealous Web Mimms got                         to go off and fight with you and                         Cole. Now it's my turn.               Jesse takes this in silently.                                     JESSE                         Jim, you been with a girl yet?                                     JIM                         Tonight? Why, I'm just getting                         ready to turn on the Younger charm.               Jesse raises an eyebrow.                                     JIM  (CONT'D)                         Well, not exactly.                                     JESSE                         You been with a girl ever?                                     JIM                              (insulted)                         Hell yeah! I been with...                              (sighs)                         Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't                         want to get one of these paid                         ladies, you know?                                     JESSE                         I think so.                                     JIM                         You and Frank and Cole, and even                         Bob, get all these girls because                         you're good looking and famous. You                         don't have to pay. They just look at                         me like I'm the baby brother.                              (then)                         Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?                                     JESSE                         I swear.                                     JIM                              (whispering)                         Tell you something else.                              (belches)                         I can't drink that good neither.                         I'm going to go outside and throw up.                                     JESSE                         You do that.               Jim stumbles away and OUT THE DOOR. We hear him THROWING UP               ENERGETICALLY a moment later. Jesse thinks for a moment,               beckons over the bartender.               INT. SALOON - A FEW MINUTES LATER               Jim stumbles back in. A pretty young woman, LYLA,               approaches him.                                     LYLA                         Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger?               Jim pulls himself together.                                     JIM                         Why, yeah.                                     LYLA                         I hope you don't mind, Jesse James                         told me your name.                                     JIM                              (crestfallen)                         Oh, you were talking to Jesse.                                     LYLA                         Yes, but just so I could find out                         who you were.               Jim brightens.                                     JIM                         Really?                                     LYLA                         I hope I'm not being too forward.                                     JIM                         Not at all.                                     LYLA                         I just though you were awful cute.                                     JIM                         Thank you, Miss -- ?                                     LYLA                         Lyla Devereux.                                     JIM                         Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you                         a drink?                                     LYLA                         Could we go upstairs and talk? It's                         so loud down here.                                     JIM                              (trying to stay                              smooth)                         Why don't we get a bottle of sherry                         to sip while we talk?                                     LYLA                         That is so gentlemanly of you.               As they head to the bar, WE SEE Jesse slide some money to               the bartender.                                     JIM                              (crossing)                         Devereux. My brother Cole dated a                         European girl once.                                     LYLA                         Really?                                     JIM                         Don't talk about it much, though.               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM               Parker is leading Rains into the room. Rains SNAPS SHUT his               ever-present Pocketwatch.                                     PARKER                         The final route for the railroad is                         complete.                                     RAINS                         I look forward to seeing it.               A group of RAILROAD MEN wait around, wearing forced smiles.               Parker shows Rains the map.               REVEAL the wall-sized map of the United States. The plainly               marked RAIL LINE extends due west from New York, through               Philadelphia, a straight shot west --               -- until it reaches Missouri, where it takes a painfully               obvious swing in a large semi-circle south of the state,               then swings up again and continues due west.               Rains takes this in. Parker and the railroad men are trying               to look casual.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)                         Parker.                                     PARKER                         Sir?                                     RAINS                         What is that?                                     PARKER                         What, sir?               Suddenly, viciously, Rains GRABS PARKER BY THE NECK and               SLAMS his face against the map.                                     RAINS                              (calmly)                         That.                                     PARKER                              (strangled)                         Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.               Rains drops Parker, who slides to the floor stunned. He               turns to JENKINS, who is suddenly in an open area cleared by               the retreating railroad men.                                     JENKINS                         Sir.                                     RAINS                         Jenkins.                                     JENKINS                         We've done a financial study of the                         construction costs projected into --                                     RAINS                         Jenkins.                                     JENKINS                         It's cheaper to go around Jesse                         James, sir. Even with the detour and                         the extra track. It's just cheaper.               Rains turns to look at the map.                                     RAINS                         So he's won.                                     PINKERTON (O.S.) (O.S.)                         No.               ANGLE ON               The entire group looking at a serene Pinkerton staring at               the James Gang tracking map, which is now festooned with red               markers.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         Every three months, the James Gang                         circles back to the vicinity of                         Liberty, Missouri. They always pull                         a job right before they return,                         probably to have extra money to give                         family and friends.

PINKERTON                         There are only four banks within                         that travel radius which they have                         not robbed.                                     RAINS                         Can you put men at all four?                                     PINKERTON                         No need. I have another tool at my                         disposal which will narrow it down                         to one bank.                                     RAINS                         What is that?

Rains begins to smile back.               EXT. WESTERN TOWN - EVENING               A populous town with the fanciest SALOON we've seen yet.               EXT. SALOON - SIDEWALK - EVENING               Out on a sidewalk, Jesse stands alone at the edge of the               building. He's holding an envelope.               HIS POV reveals the address: "Miss Zerelda Mimms, Liberty,               Missouri."               BACK TO SHOT               as Jesse reaches up to the street lantern and lights the               envelope on fire. He drops it to the ground and watches it               smolder.               Bob Younger walks up, holding a "Wanted" poster.                                     BOB                         Finally.               Jesse looks, grins.

SALOON - GAMBLING ROOM               Back in a semiprivate card room, Cole is talking to the               rest of the Gang.

Jesse and Frank step from the shadows. Cole tosses them a               newspaper.                                     COLE                         Hyperion Bank, two day's ride from                         Liberty. They've got a hundred                         thousand dollars in railroad money                         just sitting there.               Jesse tosses the paper aside.                                     JESSE                         Smells funny, it being mentioned in                         the paper.                                     COLE                         If you'd read about it first, you'd                         have no problems.

FRANK                         No, I --                                     COLE                         So being with me is being against                         you? Well, we don't want to do that!                         None of us poor idiots want to go up                         against the famous Jesse James,                         greatest outlaw who ever lived!               Jesse glares at Cole. The Gang is murmuring amongst               themselves.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         That's what the newspapers say.                         Weren't for Jesse James, this gang                         wouldn't be able to find a goat's                         ass with a stick.                                     BOB                         What?               Clell Miller leans forward.                                     CLELL                         You have got mighty full of                         yourself lately, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         You think so. You all do?                              (to Frank)                         You?               Frank hesitates a half-second too long.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                              (spitting)                         Beautiful.                                     COLE                         Now the one time one of us comes up                         with an idea --                                     JESSE                         A bad idea.                                     COLE                         I got us through the War all right.                                     JESSE                         And almost got hanged in peacetime.                                     COLE                         That's it.               Cole LUNGES for Jesse, and in a flash they're               streetfighting, all elbows and knees and rib punches,               GRUNTING and SWEARING. Frank and Bob try to break it up, but               it's too fierce.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Let them fight it out. The poison                         needs to leave the wound, to heal.               Jesse lands a ROUNDHOUSE, knocking Cole away. Cole goes for               his gun, and in a blur they've both DRAWN and stand facing               each other with cocked six-guns. The Gang watches in stunned               silence.                                     BOB                         This is healing?                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Sometimes a wound will kill.                                     BOB                         Now you tell us.                                     FRANK                              (edging in)                         Boys, we don't want this.               Neither Jesse nor Cole will back down. They circle, still               keeping their guns up.                                     COLE                              (gritted teeth)                         I'm the better soldier, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         And I'm the better outlaw.               Jim steps up.                                     JIM                         And you both hate the railroad.                         That's what's important. We do this                         job, and Thaddeus Rains won't dare                         come West again.               Jesse's gaze slides to Jim.                                     JESSE                         What about that Rock Island bastard?                                     JIM                         It's his money.  He's putting up                         the payroll out of his own fortune.                         You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains,                         don't you Jesse?               Jesse and Cole stare at each other again.                                     JESSE                         Still smells fishy.                                     COLE                         Then let me run the show, General                         Lee.               Jesse thumbs down the hammer of his Colt. Cole does the               same. The entire Gang breathes out as one.                                     JESSE                         Fine. We hit this bank.                                     COLE                         You'll be smiling once you've got                         all that money to spend, cousin.                              (to Gang)                         Cole Younger's going to make                         everybody rich!               The Gang CHEERS. Frank watches Jesse cross to the WINDOW               and sag against it, exhausted.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. HYPERION BANK - DAY               The James Gang rides up to the bank. A WATER TOWER can be               seen behind the building opposite the bank.               Jesse, Cole and Frank dismount and move swiftly to the bank               doors. Comanche Tom, Jim Younger, Clell Miller and Loni               Packwood dismount and take defensive positions. The few               other Gang members stay on their horses, looking sharp.               ANGLE ON               Cole holds up at the door, produces his shotgun. Frank and               Jesse draw six guns. On Cole's lead, they KICK OPEN THE               DOORS AND RUSH IN.               INT. HYPERION BANK               Cole and the James brothers stride in.                                     COLE                         Nobody move! This is a robbery!               The dozen or so farmers and tellers raise their hands.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Loni is whistling away, rubbing his lucky rabbit's foot. He               squints up at the sun, turns, then stops. He slowly turns               back...               HIS POV reveals a dozen men APPEARING at the edge of the               opposite rooftop, aiming rifles...               Loni lets his rabbit's foot drop...               The FIRST GUNSHOTS PLOW INTO LONI! As he falls back, we see               the rabbit's foot hit the dusty ground...               The Gang leaps for cover as a HAIL OF BULLETS begins to               tear up the bank face around them.               INT. HYPERION BANK Jesse, Frank and Cole whirl to face the               door.                                     COLE                         What the --               JESSE'S POV in a mirror by the door reveals all twelve of               the men in the bank drawing guns, shotguns, one rifle --               Jesse shoves Cole and Frank down. He KICKS a stool at the               man with the rifle, dives right and ROLLS across a big oak               desk. The men begin to FIRE. As BULLETS PING around him,               Jesse FIRES from between his legs as he rolls across the               desk. The assassins start to drop.               Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the               manager's area from the bank floor. In one smooth move he's               up and RUNNING ALONG THE RAILING, defying gravity, drawing               his shoulder Colts and shooting...               The gunmen are crossing into each other's line of fire,               Jesse's movement confusing them. Jesse's killed another               five, only four left, but he's out of railing and --               CRASH! Through a teller's cage, disappearing behind the               counter. The gunmen turn and BLAST the wooden counter, some               screaming in panic.  CLICKS are heard as hammers fall on               empty magazines.               The gunmen stare at where Jesse disappeared, panting               heavily.               CLICK.               They forgot about Cole and Frank.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               The Gang is scrambling for cover. Loni's body lies in the               street, his rabbit's foot lying in a pool of his blood. The               Gang is returning fire, hiding behind water troughs, dead               horses, barely staying alive. The ROAR OF GUNFIRE is               deafening.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Head for the end of the street!                                     JIM                         Look!               At both ends of the street, WAGONS ROLL into position, each               manned by two armed Pinkertons. The Gang is trapped.               INT. HYPERION BANK               A shot of the open, empty VAULT.                                     COLE                         Dammit!                                     JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         A trap.               Cole turns. Jesse is moving the surviving cowboys into the               Vault. As the last one steps in, Jesse SLAMS the door               closed. WE HEAR MORE GUNFIRE. Frank runs in from the back of               the bank.                                     FRANK                         Another dozen out back.                                     COLE                         They gonna rush us?                                     FRANK                         They're just insurance in case we                         run.               Jesse crosses to the front door.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse sticks his head out the door.                                     JESSE                         Get inside, you --               Gunfire chews up the doorframe. Jesse pulls back inside.               INT. HYPERION BANK               Frank and Cole are shooting through the windows.

FRANK                         Got any ideas, little brother?               Jesse thinks, then smiles.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Oh Lord.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse comes CRASHING through a window! He rolls to a stop               next to one of the horses, grabs a saddlebag, then -- to the               disbelief of the Gang -- he pivots and CRASHES right back               into the Bank!               INT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse stumbles to his feet, yanks open the bag. Sticks of               dynamite tumble out.

HYPERION BANK               WE PAN across the trapped Gang, still under fire, to the               front of the next door Saloon, and then WE ZIP               INT. SALOON               Where wary patrons have taken cover from the gunfire.               Suddenly --               BOOOM! One wall EXPLODES into dust! In the hole we see the               interior of the Bank and --               Jesse James running through, already readying another stick               of dynamite --               EXT. ROOFTOP               Where the Pinkerton gunmen are shooting at the Gang. Some               of the gunmen look curiously as the windows to the building               two doors down from the bank BLOW OUT.               EXT. STREET               As the two Pinkerton detectives at the wagon barricade turn               in shock as Jesse James LEAPS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR of a               building he can't possibly be in, lands on the wagon, rolls               off and DASHES INTO a blacksmith shop across the street.               They suddenly notice a HISS. They stand, look in the wagon.               Jesse left a burning stick of dynamite in the wagon.               ANGLE ON               the wagon EXPLODING into matchsticks.               INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP               The blacksmith is gone, but there's a fire in the FORGE.

ROOFTOP               The Pinkertons firing on the gang notice SMOKE rising from               below them. They look down ...               REVEAL bellowing FLAMES and SMOKE enveloping the entire row               of buildings below them.               BACK TO               The roof as a PINKERTON COMMANDER runs to ledge and looks               at the rising flames himself.               A HUGE EXPLOSION is heard O.C. A large SHADOW creeps over               the snipers. They turn and look up --               -- at the Water Tower TOPPLING towards them!               The Pinkertons dive out of the way as the tower SMASHES               onto the roof, unleashing a TIDAL WAVE of water!               EXT. STREET               UPSHOT of the sniper's ledge as the Pinkertons leap off,               followed by a WALL OF WATER --               WIDEN to see the water POURING into the building from above               --               Cowboys FLY out the windows, followed by TORRENTS of water               --               One Pinkerton SWEPT UP and carried off the roof, BOUNCES               off a second floor balcony and lands in a puddle on the dirt               street below.

The Gang leaps onto               the horses and put the spurs to them hard.               ANGLE ON               the Gang galloping past the shattered wagon barricade,               heading for the edge of town.               Pinkerton riflemen run out of the bank and from behind the               other barricade. One SHARPSHOOTER with a rifle drops to one               knee, lines up...               HIS POV shows Jesse in his sights. He tightens on the               trigger, and just as he pulls --               -- Jim Younger rides into the line of fire! With a CRACK               the bullet hits Jim square in the back. He slumps forward on               his horse. Comanche Tom leaps from his horse onto Jim's and               urges it on.               ANGLE ON               The James Gang disappearing past the edge of town. The               Pinkertons stand stunned amongst the ruin of their ambush.               Alan Pinkerton himself walks up, shaking his head.               EXT. HILL COUNTRY - EVENING               The Gang rides up onto a wooded hill where huge rocks jut               from the earth. They all dismount, Jesse and Cole supporting               Jim's limp form as they pull him from the saddle. Jim is               drenched in blood.                                     JESSE                         Okay, you're gonna rest here.                                     COLE                         Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in                         Liberty!                                     CLELL                         That's a long ride, Cole. We won't                         be back 'til morning.                                     JESSE                         Then you better get going!               Cole and Jesse are united again in their grief over Jim.                                     COLE                         Bob, rip up some bandages.                                     JESSE                         Pass me some whisky.               Jim's eyes flutter open for the first time.                                     JIM                         ... too young for whisky...                                     JESSE                         This time we'll make an exception.                                     JIM                         Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My                         girl, you know, from that time...                                     JESSE                         You're gonna tell her when you're                         resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.                                     COLE                         Jim, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.                                     JIM                         Best time of my life.                              (weakly)                         I was famous, y'know...               Jim dies. Cole cradles the body, begins rocking. Comanche               Tom puts a hand on Bob's shoulder as Bob slumps against a               rock.               Jesse stands, walks away heavily.               EXT. HILLTOP - A WHILE LATER               Sunset is heavy in the sky. Jesse stares off at it. His               anguish is palpable. Frank comes over.                                     JESSE                         Shoulda learned with Web. Made it                         look fun, made it look like an                         adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.                                     FRANK                         Jim was old enough...                                     JESSE                              (snorts)                         He was a boy riding with the most                         famous outlaws in the West. How was                         he supposed to say no to that?                                     FRANK                         Railroad burned him out too. You                         couldn't have stopped him.                                     JESSE                         You're a piss-poor liar for the                         smartest man I know.                                     FRANK                         Yeah.                                     JESSE                         A war against the railroad. What                         the hell were we thinking?                                     FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a good idea                         at the time.               Jesse remembers the first time Frank said that. He crosses               BACK TO               the Gang.               ANGLE ON               the Gang -- what's left of them -- waiting by the horses.               The unspoken knowledge of whose fault this is hangs in the               air.               Cole is covered in Jim's blood.                                     COLE                         We'll make them pay for this.                                     JESSE                         I'm out.                                     COLE                         WHAT?! We follow you for a year,                         and now that our blood's been                         spilled, you're gonna quit?!                                     JESSE                         Who's next? You? Me? Bob?               Cole can't answer.                                     CLELL                         We can't exactly go back to our                         lives, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         I'm not telling you what to do. You                         want to keep on following Cole, fine                         by me.                                     BOB                         Frank?               Frank nods. He's leaving too.                                     COLE                         Go ahead. Ride on. But don't come                         back when you figure out you can't                         farm with a six-gun.               Bob embraces Frank. Jesse goes to shake hands with Cole,               but the guilt and rage make his once-best friend               unapproachable. Jesse smiles sadly and walks away.               EXT. MIMMS HOME - EARLY MORNING               Zee is letting a dog out. She looks up, freezes. Entranced,               she walks out onto the porch.               ANGLE ON               A figure appearing out of the early morning fog. It's               Jesse, riding slow. He reins his horse in at the porch,               dismounts. He stands staring at Zee.                                     JESSE                         Zee.                                     ZEE                         Jesse. What are you thinking? There                         are bounty hunters and lawmen all                         over this county!                                     JESSE                         I had to see you. I'm getting                         married.               Zee is shocked. Jesse looks serious.                                     ZEE                         I don't understand.                                     JESSE                         She's the most wonderful woman in                         the world. Can't get her out of my                         mind.                                     ZEE                         That's... wonderful. It's just... I                         thought...                                     JESSE                         She's beautiful. Smart. And has the                         biggest... buck teeth in all of                         Missouri.               It takes Zee a second. Before she can process it all, Jesse               drops to one knee.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live                         in my home and in my heart.               Zee takes the hat off Jesse's head, tosses it into the yard               and smiles. Jesse stands up and they kiss.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. HORSE DRAWN TAXI - DAY               Victorian wooden houses with tin roofs and palm trees line               the street.               Jesse and Zee ride in the back of the open carriage. They               can't take their eyes off each other.                                     ZEE                         I would never have imagined us in a                         place like this.                                     JESSE                         That's why I picked it. We can                         start a whole new life down here.                                     ZEE                         Are you going to be happy here, Mr.                         James? Without all that excitement?                                     JESSE                         I've got you. You keep me busy. I                         figure we'll get over to the                         hotel... get checked in, cleaned                         up... then I'd like to do something                         I've been thinking about for a long                         time.                                     ZEE                         Now wait a minute. There are                         certain things that have to wait                         until after the wedding.               Jesse leans forward to the DRIVER.                                     JESSE                         Driver, change of plans. Take us to                         the nearest church.                                     DRIVER                         What religion?                                     JESSE                         Whichever one has God in it,                         that'll do fine.               INT. CHURCH RECTORY - DAY               A PASTOR sits at his desk while Jesse finishes filling out               a marriage license.                                     PASTOR                         This is unusual. Most of our                         marriages are members of the                         congregation.                                     JESSE                         You don't think God'll mind, do you?               Jesse slides him two twenties with the license.                                     PASTOR                         The Lord is remarkably tolerant of                         the charitable.                              (reading the license)                         "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James?                         The Jesse James?                                     JESSE                         I could have lied I suppose, but I                         want this marriage to be legal. I                         just want you to know, I'm trying to                         start a new life here. I'm depending                         on your...                                     PASTOR                         Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the                         cloth.                                     JESSE                         Thank you.                                     PASTOR                         Who needs to repair a leaky church                         roof.               Grinning, Jesse slides over another forty.                                     PASTOR  (CONT'D)                         Now let's have a drink.                                     JESSE                         Right here in church?                                     PASTOR                         Communion.               The Pastor pours. They drink.               EXT. CHURCH - DAY               The BELLS RING as Jesse and Zee walk out the front door arm               in arm.  The Pastor and his wife appear in the doorway,               waving. Jesse and Zee hop in a waiting carriage.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. BANK - DAY               Various townsfolk are lined up at the TELLER'S window.               Cole, Bob, Comanche Tom, Clell and some NEW GANG MEMBERS               BURST IN.                                     COLE                         Nobody move! This is a robbery.               Everybody's hands reach for the ceiling. Cole gestures to               the Teller.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         The safe.

COLE                         What?                                     TELLER                         Where is Jesse James?                                     COLE                         This here is the Younger Gang!               A MAN speaks out timidly.                                     MAN                         But the Youngers ride with Jesse                         James.                                     COLE                         Did ride. No more.               The crowd grumbles, plainly disappointed.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)                         OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!

Bob and Comanche Tom exchange looks behind a fuming Cole.               INT. SALOON - NIGHT               The new Gang is spending its booty. Cole is putting a               healthy dent in a bottle of rotgut. Bob is consoling him.                                     BOB                         This is the best score yet.                                     COLE                         It's still taking too long. The                         people used to snap to.                                     BOB                         That was because of... the                         reputation the gang had.                                     COLE                         As long as people think Jesse's                         still riding, we will never get the                         respect we deserve.                                     BOB                         Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly                         the most respectable job, if you                         know what I mean.                                     COLE                         Leave me alone, Bob.               Even Bob can't reach Cole now. He walks sadly away.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. BEACH - DAY               A deserted Keys beach -- coconut palms and Australian               pines. Clear water like glass stretching off forever.               Jesse and Zee are having a picnic on the white sand. Both               are in the latest in beach attire. He's in a one-piece that               goes from his neck to his knees. Zee's in what is basically               a dress with long pantaloons.               Zee is reading. Jesse is stretched out on the sand.                                     ZEE                         Hmm.                                     JESSE                         "Hmm" what?

ZEE                         Jesse, have you ever noticed that                         when you're trying to charm your way                         out of trouble, your accent gets all                         farm boy?                                     JESSE                         Aw, shucks, ma'am...                                     ZEE                         Stop it. This is just sad.                                     JESSE                         Swimming. Swimming is good.               Jesse jumps up and OUT OF FRAME. A second later, he reaches               down and PULLS a chuckling Zee up out of the sand.               EXT. OCEAN - DAY               Jesse chases Zee out into the surf. They splash around               until the water gets shoulder-deep, then both submerge. They               reappear, locked in a kiss. CLOSE ON Zee's face as they               break the kiss and embrace. She's in heaven. She opens her               eyes, facing the beach. Something passes over her face.               ANGLE ON               the beach, where fifty Pinkerton detectives with rifles are               lined up like a firing squad.               BACK TO               Zee's face. She squeezes Jesse tighter.                                     ZEE                         Don't turn around.                                     JESSE                         What?                                     ZEE                         If you don't see it, it's not                         real...               Jesse turns around to see --               EXT. BEACH               A familiar figure walking along the sand. When the figure               reaches the center of the line of detectives, he turns to               the couple and --                                     PINKERTON                         Jesse James, you are under arrest!               Jesse takes one longing gaze at the open ocean. He heads               for shore.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               INT. SALOON               Cole and the Gang are killing time. Bob runs in.                                     BOB                         They arrested Jesse!               He throws the paper to the other Gang members, but walks               straight to Cole. The two brothers stare at each other.                                     COLE                         How'd they --                                     BOB                         What have you done?                                     COLE                         I ain't done --                                     BOB                         WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!               Bob draws on Cole. Cole is shattered.                                     COLE                         Bob. I didn't...                                     BOB                         Swear.

Comanche Tom's               hand closes over Bob's gun.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         Bob. You know Cole would never do                         such a thing. He and Jesse are best                         friends. They are cousins, blood                         brothers.               Bob considers it, lowers the gun.                                     BOB                         I'm sorry, Cole.                                     COLE                         You're just upset about Jesse. We                         all are.               Bob walks off. Comanche Tom speaks, but keeps his eyes on               Bob.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         My people know that when a brother                         kills a brother, a great curse comes                         down on that man, and when he dies                         he walks the desert as a dark                         spirit. I like Bob too much to let                         that happen.                              (looking at Cole)                         If I find out you turned in Jesse,                         I'll kill you myself.               Comanche Tom moves off. Cole's thoughts are his own.                                                               DISSOLVE TO:               EXT. FORT JEFFERSON - NIGHT               An establishing shot of the Florida fort being lashed by               rain.               INT. CELL               A dank, black cell far in the bowels of Fort Jefferson. WE               HEAR CLANKING.               WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse doing push-ups. They come easily,               despite Jesse being chained up like the Frankenstein monster.               The DOOR OPENS. Jesse looks up in mid-push-up. Alan               Pinkerton is looking down at him.               Jesse moves to the bed. Pinkerton, flanked by two guards,               ENTERS. He sits on a stool provided by one of the guards.                                     PINKERTON                         We're moving you tomorrow.                                     JESSE                         But I like the presidential suite.                                     PINKERTON                         Oh, it's a similar room. But the                         hotel is in Washington D.C. You're                         not going to get a fair trial down                         here, in front of a jury of Jesse                         James sympathizers.                                     JESSE                         So I'll get a fair trial in front                         of a jury bought off by Thaddeus                         Rains?                                     PINKERTON                         That's the idea.               Pinkerton produces two cigars, presenting one to Jesse.                                     JESSE                         Did you order our houses burned                         down?                                     PINKERTON                         Not that day. I am guilty of many                         things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus                         Rains and Parker, that day.               Jesse takes the cigar, and Pinkerton lights both. They puff               for a moment.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                              (tapping bad leg)                         Was this you, by the way?               Jesse exposes his scar.                                     JESSE                         You almost ended my career before                         it began.                                     PINKERTON                         Pity.               Pause.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         How did you spot the ambush in                         Torrell?                                     JESSE                         Last February?                                     PINKERTON                         Mmm.                                     JESSE                         You had all those cattle there, so                         I'd think the extra men were in town                         from the cattle drive?                                     PINKERTON                         Yes?                                     JESSE                         The cows had a brand from a farm                         just five miles out of town.                                     PINKERTON                         Damn.               Pause.                                     JESSE                         Almost got me in Billings. I saw                         you there, shooting at me.                                     PINKERTON                         I went myself to oversee the                         operation. Didn't help much.                                     JESSE                         No, that one was close. A couple                         fellas quit after that one.                                     PINKERTON                         Oh. That's nice to know.                              (then)                         We're going to hang you, you know.                                     JESSE                         I figured.                                     PINKERTON                         Was it worth it?                                     JESSE                         Should have just killed Thaddeus                         Rains and been done with it.                                     PINKERTON                         That's what I would have done.                                     JESSE                         I'm not hanged yet.                                     PINKERTON                              (shaking his head)                         You cocky little bastard.                                     JESSE                         Ahh, you'll miss me.                                     PINKERTON                         No, I'll hang you.                              (then)                         But I may miss you just a bit.               As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and discuss the past year...               EXT. TRAINYARD               Two guards are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons,               toward a prison car at the end of a waiting train.               Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and Parker walk up.                                     RAINS                         This is him.                                     PARKER                         I remember you.                                     JESSE                         You're Parker. I remember you, too.                         You killed my Ma.               Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear --                                     PARKER                         How did you know?                                     RAINS                         Not such a menace now, is he,                         Pinkerton?                                     PINKERTON                         If you feel that way, I could                         always take off the irons.               Rains glares at Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse.                                     RAINS                         You stole thousands. You cost me                         tens of millions of dollars, months                         of lost construction. I wish I could                         hang you every single morning for a                         century.               Rains checks his Pocketwatch, spots Jesse eyeing it.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)                         You like that? Solid gold, my                         father had it made when he started                         this railroad. He gave it to me when                         I took over, I'll give it to my son                         when he runs this company, and he'll                         give it to his son -- The right type                         of men will always run this country,                         Jesse James, and little men like you                         will always suffer. You have stopped                         nothing.                                     JESSE                         Made you think twice about burning                         folks' homes down now, didn't I?               Jesse winks.               With that Parker reaches back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse.               Rains gloats as Jesse gets his breath back.                                     RAINS                         We'll speak again in Washington,                         you insect.                                     JESSE                         You're coming on the same train?               Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his               head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several               cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed               with Pinkerton detectives.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Well, tell you what. I'm going to                         have to pay you a visit.                                     RAINS                         Big words.                                     JESSE                         It's a promise.               Everyone is a little shaken by the steel in Jesse's voice.               The guards DRAG JESSE OFF.               INT. PRISON CAR               The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE. Pinkerton               enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in total in               the car.                                     PINKERTON                         Hook him up.               The Burly Detective brings Jesse's arms above his head. He               loops Jesse's chain over a rail that runs the length of the               car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down the car, Jesse's               hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just barely sit               down.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         Now the guns.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         I don't like it. We can handle him.                                     PINKERTON                         In the ten seconds we have been in                         this car, I have seen you get close                         enough for Jesse James to grab your                         guns at least three times. And I                         assure you, if he gets his hands on                         one of your guns, you are all, and I                         mean all dead men.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         He's chained up.                                     PINKERTON                         I'll put that on your tombstone.                         The guns.               Grumbling, the detectives deposit their pistols in a box               near the front of the car. Pinkerton walks out.               The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waistband.               ANGLE ON               Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pinkerton guards. The train               LURCHES, and they're off.               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY               The prison train highballs through the wooded, rolling               hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective car,               then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and               then the prison car.               INT. PRISON CAR               Five guards are playing poker. Five others are standing               along the length of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box               waaay down the other end of the car.               Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train is going               downhill.                                     JESSE                         Hey, fatty.               The Burly Detective looks up.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         What?                                     JESSE                         You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here                         piggy piggy!               The detectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly               Detective moves right up on him.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         What you sayin' boy?                                     JESSE                         I think I recognize you.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         How?                                     JESSE                         I think I saw you leavin' by the                         front door just as I was coming in                         the back.               The other detectives try to hide grins.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE                         You shut up now, boy.                                     JESSE                         No, really. You're wife said she                         needed some help, seeing as you were                         so fat you couldn't find your --               Burly Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and               grins.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Yeah, she said you did that to her                         too.               Burly draws, points the gun right at Jesse's face. The               other detectives GASP. Jesse stares down the barrel, then               raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and               terrifying.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Y'know, I could do this without the                         gun, but it just makes things easier.               SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES,               missing Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a               mongoose.               Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun               drops right into Jesse's hands --               The guards are running for the gun box --               Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF from               the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the               detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun,               blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's               ceiling strut, and then KICKS at the roof.               The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropping Jesse to the floor. In a               blur he's up, reaching into the gun box. He tosses one gun               INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of another.               Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top               of him and nobody's that fast --               Jesse drops the spent gun, CATCHES the other gun in the               opposite hand and FANS THAT HAMMER all in a single breath!               As the smoke clears, the last of the detectives falls with               a THUD.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a               gunbelt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still               holding the chain from his restraints. Now that they're no               longer wrapped around Jesse, we see they're at least a few               yards long.               INT. THIRD TROOP CAR               Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds from on top of the               car.               EXT. TRAIN               And Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and --               CLANK as the chains -- fastened to the roof -- go taut and               Jesse is at window level and he's FIRING AND FIRING into the               car!               INT. THIRD TROOP CAR               Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a               bead on Jesse because --               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse is running along the side of the car, supported by               the chain! Still shooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and               is on the roof again.               ANGLE ON               one Detective, barely alive, stumbling through the door,               opening the door to the next               INT. SECOND TROOP CAR               The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into               the doorway.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse looks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming               out of the doorway.                                     JESSE                         Shit.               But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the               EXT. SECOND TROOP CAR               Jesse's running and the Pinkertons start SHOOTING THROUGH               the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched, almost to the               CLUB CAR...               INT. CLUB CAR               Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains               look around.                                     RAINS                         What the hell is that sound?                                     PINKERTON                         Vengeance.               INT. FIRST TROOP CAR               Pinkerton bursts in. The men snap to.                                     PINKERTON                         Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!               EXT. CLUB CAR               Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as               detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other               detectives climbing up behind him. He's trapped.               BUT WE HEAR A LOW WHISTLE AND               EXT. TRAIN ENGINE               The engine EXPLODES! Sparks fly as the twisted engine               GRINDS onto the tracks!               EXT. TRAIN               The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some               detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the               roof of the Club Car --                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               CLOSE ON a smoking CANNON sitting on the tracks. WIDEN TO               REVEAL Frank and Cole on horseback shading their eyes. Zee               is daintily blowing out a fuse lighter.                                     FRANK                         Nice shot.                                     ZEE                         Thank you. Now go get my husband.               The two men start to gallop toward the train.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse, Pinkerton, and the detectives look down the track               and see...               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods ride               Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect               formation. The four THUNDER toward the train.               INT. CLUB CAR               Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out               the window.                                     PARKER                         There's only four of them...                                     PINKERTON                         Move you fools!               He grabs the two businessmen and heads them to the rear of               the train.               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               Frank draws a gun and FIRES.               EXT. WOODS               TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the               Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the               train cars as the riders strafe the train.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the               window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back               along the top of the train.               EXT. PRISON CAR               Pinkerton, Rains and Parker tumble out of the door and run               for the woods.               Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton!               They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his               gunbelt.               Empty.               With almost a resigned sigh, he looks up. Jesse's pointing               the gun at Pinkerton's head.                                     PINKERTON                         Do it.               Jesse FIRES.               ANGLE ON               Pinkerton, stunned to realize he's still alive. He turns to               see Parker, fall to the ground, his own gun half-drawn,               Jesse turns the gun on Rains.                                     JESSE                         That was for my Ma. Now this is for                         everybody else.                                     PINKERTON                         He's too important, James.  They'll                         set the army on you. You and your                         wife.               Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension               building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says:                                     JESSE                         That is a nice watch you got there.               Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't               broken.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I tell you what, I'll buy that                         watch from you, for the fair market                         price approved by the Department of                         the Interior: one dollar.               Rains hesitates. Jesse thumbs the hammer back                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         If I were you, I'd sell. After                         this, the price goes...down.               Rains tosses the Watch to Jesse as Jesse simultaneously               FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free hand. Jesse holds up               the Watch.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Now every time you go to look at                         this watch and it's not there,                         you'll remember: You can be stopped.                         Pass that down to your son, instead.               Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun. Rains               falls to his knees, numb from the tension.               Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it               to him. Pinkerton holds him for a second.                                     PINKERTON                              (low)                         Tennessee.               Jesse doesn't understand.                                     PINKERTON  (CONT'D)                         The railroad has no business in                         Tennessee. Therefore I have no                         interest in the state of Tennessee.                                     JESSE                         Thanks.                                     PINKERTON                         I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse                         James. But chasing you takes up too                         much of my time.                                     JESSE                         Fair enough.               Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they               RIDE OFF with Frank.               We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rains, and               revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train.               EXT. HILLSIDE FIELDS - DAY               Most of the Gang is mounted. Frank, Cole and Bob are               standing there, watching.               ANGLE ON               Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse.                                     ZEE                         You get arrested again, I'll kill                         you.                                     JESSE                         Yes ma'am.                                     ZEE                         I can't believe I had to blow up a                         train for you.                                     JESSE                         You are a hell of a woman.                                     ZEE                         Don't swear.                                     JESSE                         Yes ma'am.               They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse, gets one               of Cole's BEAR HUGS.                                     COLE                         Missed you, cousin.                                     JESSE                         Missed you too, cousin.               Jesse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite               figure out what's going on.                                     COLE                         You know, you gettin' caught, right                         after leaving us, some people                         thought --                                     JESSE                         Pff. All we been through, the                         thought never crossed my mind.               The two clasp hands.                                     BOB                         Things changed when you quit the                         gang. For example, I'm now the one                         who says "Let's ride."                                     COLE                         He's not bad at it.                                     BOB                         It's tougher than it looks.                                     JESSE                         Where'd you get all these riders?                                     COLE                         We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out                         your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.                                     BOB                         So what's the plan?               Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank.                                     JESSE                         I think my wife and I might go down                         Tennessee way, buy a farm.                              (pause)                         Goodbye, boys.               The Youngers smile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers               SADDLE UP, Comanche Tom leans down from the saddle and               shakes Jesse's hand.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         You stay out of trouble, Jesse.                         Nobody has as much luck as you used                         up today.               ANGLE ON               Jesse getting back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands               there and watches them.                                     FRANK                         I'll meet you down there in a few                         weeks.                                     JESSE                         See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate                         the distraction back there.                                     FRANK                         Hell, they hardly even noticed us.               Jesse and Frank grin.                                     BOB                         Let's ride!               Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RIDE OFF, the GANG               with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite direction.               Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly:                                     ZEE                         Tennessee?                                     JESSE                         I'll explain on the way.               Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind               him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and               now he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and...               EXT. HILLSIDE NEAR LIBERTY - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER               ...we COMPLETE THE CIRCLE and see young Frank James is now               an older FRANK JAMES. Still lean, a few wrinkles, a little               grey in the hair, dressed in expensive turn-of-the-century               western clothes. A young man who looks remarkably like               Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting patiently. The               two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri, which               is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is               disappearing under roads and telegraph wire.                                     JIMMY                         Y'know, Uncle Frank...                                     FRANK                         Yeah, Jimmy?                                     JIMMY                              (genially chiding)                         ...every time you tell that story,                         you stop there. That's not how it                         ended. I was five when my dad got                         shot.                                     FRANK                         I know. But that's how it should                         have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding                         off into a new life, growing old                         together, happy.               They start to walk back to the edge of town.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Allow a man his version of the                         past. When you get to be my age,                         you've got enough painful memories,                         you're allowed to soften a few of                         the edges up.                                     JIMMY                         Sounds like he was a hell of a man.                                     FRANK                              (chuckling)                         That he was.                                     JIMMY                         They're making him a hero now.                                     FRANK                         Saved a lot of folk from the                         railroad.                                     JIMMY                         But he killed a lot of men, too.                                     FRANK                         Can't argue that.                                     JIMMY                         So what was he?                                     FRANK                         I think... he was just a real                         interestin' fella to have around.               Frank chuckles again at the memories, claps his hand on               Jimmy's shoulder.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Come on, your Ma's probably holding                         dinner for us. Once saw the woman                         blow up a train, don't want to tick                         her off...               Jimmy grins and the pair walk down the hill. We stay ON               THEIR BACKS as they continue talking.                                     JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Uncle Frank?                                     FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Yeah Jimmy?                                     JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)                         How much of that story is true?                                     FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Everything but the boring parts.

                         a swinging spy from the Sixties, was

                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW

                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several

                         domination and focus on providing

                         time portal. As you know, Austin 
                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

                         Come, Mini-Me.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in

                         And Frau you look...right.

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

               Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the 
               largest room you've ever seen in your life.

                         developed a time machine.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also

                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being

               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song:

               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a

                         spiritual teacher and I have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality

                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis. He would say to me,

                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

</b>                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere", 
                         and I am going to change that to

                         you can call it whatever you want.  
                         Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate 
                         the awesome lethality of the Alan

               A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White 
               House, causing it to explode.

               Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

               transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

               Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

               A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on 
               his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads 
               which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers 
               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth 
               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE

               Austin stumbles. Felicity looks at him.

</b>                         If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!

               The TIME PORTAL is fifty feet away. Austin and Felicity run 
               towards it. In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently 
               placed barrels. As they run behind the barrels, an obvious 
               AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE 
               emerge in their place.

               The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross 
               over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic 
               flips and stunts.

               The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed 
               pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place 
               and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999".

               It is the most up-to-date modern apartment you've ever seen 
               in your life. There is a large screen TV, a DVD player etc.

               Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other 
               accouterments of moving. Felicity puts a CD on an old style

           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

<b>          CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

<b>                         ARE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
</b>
          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

<b>                         QUIET:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

<b>          ROLLS OFF FAST --
</b>
<b>          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           "The General." To me, she's royalty.

<b>                          POE
</b>          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           We've got company.

<b>          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

<b>          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

<b>                          POE

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

<b>          IN THE DISTANCE.
</b>          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

<b>                          POE
</b>           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

<b>          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --
</b>
<b>          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
</b>          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

<b>                         HIM:
</b>
<b>                          SENIOR TROOPER

          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Look how old you've become.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA

           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           The First Order rose from the dark

</b>           You may try, but you cannot deny the

          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:

          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's

          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his

          in this moment, terrified, desperate.

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER
</b>
          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

<b>          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

<b>          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
</b>          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

<b>          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b>
          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

<b>                          UNKAR
</b>           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

<b>          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY
</b>
          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

<b>          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           NOMA.
</b>          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           That's just Teedo. Wants you for

           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           POE!!! POE!!!
</b>          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

</b>
          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

<b>          INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

<b>          BEEPING BB-8.
</b>          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

<b>                          REY
</b>           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

<b>                          REY
</b>           What's your hurry, thief?

<b>                          FINN
</b>           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

<b>          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

<b>                          FINN
</b>           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

<b>                          (RELIVING IT)

           (sees BB-8 is sad,

</b>           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

<b>                          REY
</b>           So you're with the Resistance?

</b>           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

<b>                          (WHISPERS)
</b>           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

<b>                          REY
</b>           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

<b>                          REY
</b>           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

<b>                          REY

          And that very question touches her -- having never in her

          MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
          Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its

          We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
          room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
          drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
          BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
          suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
          TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.

          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards

          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

<b>          DOOR OPENS.
</b>          Hesitant, Rey enters.

<b>          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

<b>                          YOUNG GIRL

<b>           NO!
</b>          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

          Rey suddenly stands.

<b>                          REY

           don't want any part of this.
          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

<b>          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
          Heads toward the woods.

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
</b>
          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to
           the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
           All remaining systems will bow to
           the First Order! And will remember
           this... as the last day of the

<b>          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

<b>                          GENERAL HUX

          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
</b>
          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

<b>          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC
</b>
<b>          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO

          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

<b>          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

<b>          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

<b>          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

</b>
          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive

          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
          FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

<b>          APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
</b>          NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

<b>          ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

<b>          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
</b>
          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b>
          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

<b>                          REY

<b>                          (HE BEEPS)

           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

          chasing Troopers!

          Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
          BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

          He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-

          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the

          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

<b>                          C-3PO

           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY
</b>
          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

<b>                          REY
</b>           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

<b>                          LEIA (CONT'D)
</b>           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

<b>          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
</b>
          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
</b>
          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
</b>
          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
</b>
          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

<b>          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
</b>
          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

<b>          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
</b>          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns
sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's
path.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,
determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a
business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.

Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the
footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds
and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric
strives stubbornly forward.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>1	CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
Eric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.
Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the
cold.

His hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After several
attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of
wood, exhausted and frustrated.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sits
next to it, partially covered in snow himself.

<b>ERIC
</b>
His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a
purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.
The wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting.
<b>									
</b><b>									END DREAM
</b>
<b>2	INT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Eric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a
moment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies
back down.

<b>3	EXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY
</b>
A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a
pipeline support piling:
<b>						
</b><b>			PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
</b><b>				  PRIVATE PROPERTY
</b><b>				  NO   TRESPASSING
</b><b>				  NO	  HUNTING
</b><b>				  NO	 TRAPPING
</b><b>				  NO	 SHOOTING
</b>
<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead
of him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's
confident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have a
distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan
cotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,
windless, forty-degree afternoon.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:
</b>
He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
four-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through the
scope.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,
ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She's
twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue
eyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born
in it.

Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.
But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of
a CO2-powered dart gun.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy
shoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almost
immediately slows, sits, then lies down.

Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing
deeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			What a beauty.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Hand me the transmitter.

Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all
the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.
Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some
photos.

With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			He's coming around fine.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Be right back.  I left my
			camcorder in the car.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
<b>FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
</b>
as she hurries back to their International Scout.  On the
door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,
under which are the words:
<b>						
</b><b>			NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.
</b>
Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.

<b>ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF
</b>
Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,
glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking through
the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline
piling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Anne Marie!  Stop!

She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the
dead leaves and gravel.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Don't move.

Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With
a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne
Marie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Goddamn trappers!

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Takes nerve, laying traplines on
			restricted land.

Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:  (3)
</b>
Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
Haul Road.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			What are you doing?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			He still might be around.  I saw
			fresh tire tracks coming in.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric hurries down the footpegs.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Man and a jeep, about a mile and
			a half down.

He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.

<b>4	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.

<b>5	EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES and
another Trapper appears nearby.

<b>6	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It's
oddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen.  They zoom off.

<b>7	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his
view but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust.



<b>8	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
His entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long red
hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Where the fuck did you drop
			Corbett off?

In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
looks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,
confrontation is not his style.

He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
creek.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			He's over there.

<b>9	EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard
against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.
LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the
mud.

Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.

<b>10   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Eric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay here.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Be careful -- there're two of
			them.

Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			If I unzip my parka, stick this
			out the window.

<b>11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>11   CONTINUED:
</b>
Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long
huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.

He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's
eyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton
coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt is
a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.

Eric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone as
formidable as Corbett.

<b>12   INT. / EXT. JEEP
</b>
Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			No shooting.  Let's see who's so
			interested in us.

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his
traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(to Corbett)
			Ain't worth it, Ben...

<b>13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT
</b>
As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've
been a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You got two counts against you --
			trapping out of season and
			poaching on restricted land.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Can't be much of a crime, if all
			they got minding the area is a
			cocky kid.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I got your plate number, asshole.
			Maybe you feel like spending a
			few months in jail.

Corbett just smiles.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>13   CONTINUED:
</b>
But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep
window.

Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly
unzips his parka.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Ben?  Sure you don't want me to
			drop the fucker?

Corbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he looks
past Eric at the Scout.

<b>CORBETT'S POV
</b>
The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
Marie's backing him up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You leave and don't come back,
			that's the end of it.

After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away
from Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.

Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat.

<b>ANGLE ON TRAPPERS
</b>
Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.
LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.
While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.

<b>14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING
</b>
Eric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes
on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.

The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the
driver's seat, and they take off.

<b>15   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>15   CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(unnerved)
			Great idea -- pointing a lousy
			dart gun at some nut with a
			high-powered hunting rifle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Bastards took off, though, didn't
			they?

<b>16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.
Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.

<b>17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the
window.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			All this fuckin' land, and we're
			locked out.  Makes me puke.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Jawing about it won't change it.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Three hundred seventy-five
			million acres in this state.  I'm
			real tired of runnin' into
			people.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Then don't look to your left.

<b>18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
bend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other
garbage.

Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.
They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops.

<b>19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
LeMalle grabs his carbine.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Leave it here.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>19   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Let's keep going.  We're only an
			hour from Devil's Cauldron.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(pats Mitchell's shoulder)
			Relax.  I just want to ask them
			how the hunting is.

<b>20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
Corbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,
their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.

The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He
walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,
Corbett smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Looks like you've had some luck.
			Where's your guide?
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>			We're on our own, if it's any of
			your damn business.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(re ermine)
			You did real good.

He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(to Corbett)
			No swinging shit.  They're over
			their goddamned limit.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Sportsmen)
			My friend is right.  Supposed to
			have a licensed guide when you're
			on this land, too.
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>			Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit
			fees.

LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire.  No one
notices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips his
parka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>20   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #2
</b>			I were you, I'd drive right on
			outta here again.  Now.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(calmly)
			This was my roaming land, 'til
			the government took it over.
			Only Innuit can hunt here now,
			and tourists, like you.

Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
the Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to
him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			According to tribal law, hunters
			passing through the land of
			another tribe can only take game
			to survive.  They can eat the
			meat, but have to surrender the
			hides.

LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
ermine.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Want the meat?
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>
			Fuck you, dirtball.

Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.

<b>WIDER
</b>
LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
Land Rover, many still in their packages.  He helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with
			their shiny new car.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			If you're gonna take something,
			take it and let's go.

Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>20   CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol.  He swings it toward LeMalle.

LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.

There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.

Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.

Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum
six-shooter in his hand.

Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting
Corbett.  Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies the
weapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.

Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses to
LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.  After a moment:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Sportsmen)
			Put him in your truck.  Smell of
			blood will attract the bears.
			(to trappers)
			Let's go.

As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that
he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.

Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>
			I don't believe in leavin'
			witnesses behind, Ben.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			It was self defense.  Leave it at
			that.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			You think those fucks will tell
			it that way?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(ending the argument)
			We'll get a head start before

Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into the
engine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.

			You can pack out of here -- two,

Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.

<b>LEMALLE
</b>
isn't yet satisfied.  He walks back over to the Sportsmen,
kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right
beside them.  Intimidated, Sportsman #2 looks away, but
LeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Think I'm pretty?  You better
			forget how we look, 'cause next
			time they won't keep me from
			killing you.  This land ain't
			quite civilized, you know...

He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices across
the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned and
sickened.

<b>ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
Corbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			At least he scalped the dead one.

<b>21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK
</b>
Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town
squats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the
Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the
prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is
long gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter.

Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled and
horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.  Facing it

are a mud-walled fire bath, a wooden steam bath called a
Maqi, six one-room cabins for let, and an unused dance hall.

LEO MEYERLING opens the tailgate of a Dodge truck with the
Northland Petroleum logo and "District Supervisor" on the
door.  Meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face.  He staples a poster on a wall.  It has a
picture of him on it, and:
<b>						
</b><b>				LEO MEYERLING

				  State Legislature
<b>			 VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND!
</b>
<b>22   EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.

<b>23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell."  There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window.

The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is short
and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(wary)
			Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and
			I'd like to keep it that way.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(conciliatory)
			Just passing through.

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses
behind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store.

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.  Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.

			Sure have learned to worship the

Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out.  Corbett pays
him.  Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the
corkboard.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I hope I can count on you
			gentlemen to vote for The
			People's Friend this November.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Share some of that oil company
			money in your pocket and you can.

Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on
the wall.  LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the
poster between Meyerling's spread fingers.  Meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder for
support.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Meyerling)
			One flier comes loose and I shoot
			you for littering.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING

<b>24   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON VALLEY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

An early STORM has blown in from the north, bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain.

<b>25   INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.  LeMalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunches
over a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.

Mitchell glances at LeMalle, then at Corbett.

<b>26   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - "THE TURTLE" - DAY
</b>
The winds have died down.  The rain has turned to a light
snow.

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul
Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires.
The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.

An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.
The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle,
therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens.
Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.

</b><b>26   CONTINUED:
</b><b>

			Bet you're right.  But I didn't

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- We appreciate the company.
			Anne Marie's getting cabin fever
			already.

Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree --
this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			What'd you say they call these
			spaceships?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I call it 'the Turtle,' as in

</b>			Best thing is, Meyerling has to

			The little creep hates it that

Looking past Wilder, Eric points out some smoke on the
horizon.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black
			and white smoke.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Damn.  Likely that's an SOS.
			Have to pass on that lunch.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll go with you.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>27   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Everything seems peaceful enough.  The SOS fire (made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke) has burnt down to embers.

Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.

The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover,
but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers.  In the
back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.

Something is amiss.  Eric shoots a look of trepidation at
Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup.   Wilder pulls the
door of the Land Rover open.

A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground.  His eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips.  His skin is
blue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)

Startled, Eric steps back.  Anne Marie gasps with horror.
Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listens
for a heartbeat.  Nothing.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze
			to death.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			It's not even winter!
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			They got wet in the rain.  Core
			body temperature dropped, got
			drowsy, probably didn't even know
			what was happening.

Eric stares at the dead Sportsmen.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>27   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			Question is why they sat here
			when the storm moved in.  Check
			their stuff while I sniff around.

Wilder tries the ignition.  The starter TURNS OVER, but the
engine makes a horrendous GRINDING.  He walks to the front
of the vehicle.  Noticing the bullet holes in the grille, he
bends down for a closer look.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies.  Still in their packages are some matchbox-sized
ELT locating beacons.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			They had Emergency Locater
			Transmitters, but didn't use
			them.
			(opens one up; shakes his
				head)
			Maybe because they didn't bring
			batteries.

<b>CLOSE
</b>
Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover.  She pulls
back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third
Sportsman.  The torn red flesh on his head and his
bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight.

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away.

<b>28   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LAND ROVER
</b>
Eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath.

Wilder looks at the third Sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the Land Rover.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I'm too old for this shit.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Any idea who could've done it?

Sourly, Wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the
vehicle.

Wilder examines the Sportsman, finding the bullet hole in
his chest.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			Even for Ben Corbett, this is
			nasty.  Man's got balls.  He was
			sitting in Devil's Cauldron when
			I left, calm as can be.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Thank God.  You can arrest him.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Not necessarily.  Corbett's awful
			hardbitten these days.

Wilder leans against the Land Rover, feeling tired.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			His old roaming area's all
			private reserve now.  Normally,
			long as he stays civil in my
			jurisdiction, I let him be.
			(beat)
			Won't be able to take him by my

Eric looks hard at the dead Sportsmen.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

			I'll go into town with you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Eric, leave it alone.  It's not

The town is quiet.



<b>30   INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker, DIXIE.

He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.  Eric holds
Corbett's boots, which have been repaired.  Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett.  There is a flash of recognition between
them.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Ben Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Yep.  Afraid you have me at a
			disadvantage.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Kenai at the general store asked
			me to bring these.  Didn't expect
			we'd already met.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			No big deal.  We just got off on
			the wrong foot.  What's your
			name?

Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the
floor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on top
of it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interest
in it.  He leans back and smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Desmond.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			New to the country, kid?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Six months.  Ecological study for
			Northland Oil.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Ecology.  Folks use that term for
			everything but what it means:
			who's eating who.

Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and
gets out of the tub.  His sinewy body, resembling a
scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.  He
wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>30   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Now, why don't you get around to

Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a
revolver, which Eric has been hiding inside one of the
boots.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; smiling)
			You wouldn't shoot anyone...
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER (OS)
</b>			But I would.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Corbett
with a 12-gauge shotgun.  He kicks Corbett's magnum out of
reach.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			All this for laying traps on
			private land?
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			You left a footprint at the
			Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty
			sight there, Ben, 'cause the two
			men you didn't shoot and mutilate
			died of exposure.

Corbett shakes his head but remains implacable.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Christ if I shouldn't know better
			than to step in soft earth.  I've
			seen footprints in the tundra a
			hundred years old.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

			Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks
			out of my kit, will you?

Eric comes outside.  Earl Kenai, overdressed for the weather
in gloves, mukluks and a full-length sealskin coat, stands

</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Before white men came, my people

			and laid our dead on the tundra.
			Now we live above ground and bury

Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbett's
duffel bag cradled in his arm.  Handcuffed, Corbett walks in
front of him.

Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he
goes by.  Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles.

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nice bluff the other day with the
			tranquilizer gun out your jeep
			window.  See you again, maybe.

</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(unintimidated)
			Yeah.  Maybe so.

<b>32   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW WILDER

as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town.  They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower.  Mounted above the shack, a DC wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze.  From
within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV.  Wilder
KNOCKS on the door.

ARTHUR NEFF, a pasty-white, 45-year-old ex-Texan, pulls the
door open.  His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett.

<b>33   INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

Wilder pushes Corbett inside past Neff.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I need to call Fairbanks.

Neff just stares at Corbett.
<b>

			Neff!  Dial it up.  State police.

With a "what can I do but oblige?" look to Corbett, Neff
sits in front of the RCA Alascom radio telephone and dials.

Angry, Wilder slams the receiver down.

<b>34   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

In one room, there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley
heat stove, a table, a bunk and a small window.  Behind a
cloth partition is an eight by six holding cell.  The frame
of an iron-bar door is securely cemented to the log walls.
Wilder comes in with Corbett and locks him in the cell.

			Sam, listen -- I shot to defend
			my man.  Other guy drew first.

<b>36   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - NIGHT

The storm has passed.   A faint CHUGGING emanates from the
small orange generator trailer behind the Turtle.  Eric
pulls up and parks the Scout.

<b>37   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's
research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies.
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and
white prints.  All are of man-made objects whose presence is
juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.

Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at
the door and kisses him.  Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped
package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's
preparing dinner.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Did you catch Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Sure did.  He was one of the

An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and

He looks around for some sign of life.  He spots Neff

</b>			Yesterday.  Said they were going
			to Cache.  They were thirsty, but
			we were voted dry.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Shit.

As Viking Bob walks back to his station wagon, he notices
Kenai poking around in front of Wilder's cabin.

<b>VIKING BOB'S POV
</b>
Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilder's typical bush-country
front yard.  Piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps,
stove parts, saw horses, 55-gallon drums, dismantled snow
machines, wash tubs, tires, etc.

Bunching his collar around his neck, Kenai shivers and sorts
through Corbett's traps.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Viking Bob ambles over to Kenai.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			These yours?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Gonna make an offer.  Man who
			owns them won't need them where
			he's going.

<b>39   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob, then turns
to Corbett.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>39   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Back against the bars.  Now.

Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face,
covering his mouth.

Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips
outside.

As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge.

<b>40   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
The look on Wilder's face tells Kenai to shut up.  Viking
Bob realizes something's up.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Your brother and the boys left me
			some traps to sell for them.
			They're gone --
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			-- To Cache.  So I heard.  Ben
			never said nothing to me about
			selling his gear.

<b>41   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth.  He pries one
of his boots off and kicks it through a window.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Bob!  They got me on a murder
			charge!

<b>42   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Wilder pulls his .357 out.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Sorry, Bob.  I'll have to keep
			you here 'til I ship him south.

Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then
punching him in the gut.  Wilder sprawls among the junk,
dropping his revolver.  Kenai freezes, not about to take
sides.

Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for
his .357. Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>42   CONTINUED:
</b>
He dives into his station wagon and starts it up.  As he
drives past, Wilder POPS off a few rounds, but Viking Bob
keeps going.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Kenai helps Wilder up.  Pissed, Wilder shoves him against
the cabin.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			You stupid, greedy, loudmouth
			sonofabitch!  He'll have the
			others here in a few hours.  You
			fucked me up, now you're gonna
			help me move him.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			(shakes head)
			Forget it, Sam.  I never work for
			free.

<b>43   INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT
</b>
Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES.
On the monitor, it SHOWS footage of the traps under the
pipeline piling.  Eric comes out of the back module holding
two ELT pendants.  He glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I still can't believe I'm being
			financed by an oil company.
			Especially when they get a look
			at these pictures.  Technology in
			the wilderness; not too pretty.
			(re ELTs)
			What's that?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I thought I should check our
			emergency transmitters.

Eric activates the ELT's.  They emit an SOS pattern of radio
waves -- three short, three long and three short.  This is
visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Marie's video
<b>MONITOR.
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Avalanche season is coming.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>43   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Winter.  Two straight months of
			night -- we may never get out of
			bed.
			(kisses him)
			Which would suit me fine.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Prolonged darkness makes people
			crazy.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Not me.  I'm equipped.

She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the
room lights.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			Allow me to give you a practical
			demonstration of low-light
			infrared photography...

She does so by seductively undressing for the camera.  She's
SEEN on the MONITOR, illuminated by the "light" from the hot
stove.  Eric appreciates the show.  He crawls toward her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			High-tech in the wilderness.
			Gets me excited, too.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Come here...

Laughing, he wrestles her to the rug.

<b>44   EXT.  HILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</b>
There is a full moon and a clear night sky.  Viking Bob's
station wagon is parked out of sight.  He sits inside,
waiting.

He hears an ENGINE starting in the distance.  Sitting up, he
grabs some binoculars.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
Wilder's extended cab truck pulls out, heading west.

<b>45   EXT.  FOOTHILLS - NIGHT
</b>
In the bright moonlight, two people are seen in Wilder's
truck as it speeds along a dirt road.

Viking Bob follows at a discreet distance, headlights off.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>45   CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Viking Bob turns and takes the literal high road -- a narrow
trail above the roadway that Wilder's truck is on.

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry, then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush.

As Wilder's truck approaches, Viking Bob turns on his bright
lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun.

Wilder's truck screeches to a stop.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Kenai gets out with his hands up.

Viking Bob slowly approaches Wilder's truck.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Ben?

No answer.  Viking Bob looks in the cab.  Kenai's passenger
is Dixie, the Inupiat hooker.  Viking Bob grabs Kenai and
pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(continuing)
			Where's Ben Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			I have no argument with you, Bob.
			Wilder said I could keep his
			truck if I drove it ten miles
			away from town.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Where did they go?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			He didn't say, but I would guess
			the opposite way from here.

Viking Bob shoves Kenai against the truck, then punches him
for good measure.  Cussing, he runs back to his station
wagon and drives off.

Eric and Anne Marie are asleep.  Eric starts awake at the OS
sound of a high-pitched vehicle HORN and an approaching
<b>ENGINE.
</b>



<b>47   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric pulls the door open.  Wilder is untying Corbett from
the snowmobile.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I got an emergency on my hands.

Corbett smiles at Eric as he walks inside.

<b>48   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric, Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module.  Anne
Marie, nervous, wearing a down robe, serves coffee.  She
stares at Corbett, trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor
with what she saw that afternoon.  Corbett smiles at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Eric)
			...You give us a ride in the
			Cessna you got hangared at the
			pumping station, we'll be in
			Fairbanks in a few hours.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			That's what we should've done in

<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I could've sat tight for the

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Wilder; re Anne Marie)
			A lot to ask, dragging him away
			from such a good-looking girl --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(irritated)
			-- To take you to jail?  It'll be
			my pleasure.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Eric)
			You better get some sleep.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Good idea.  Flying over mountains

			inside it.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>48   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module, leaving Wilder
with his prisoner.

</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>49   INT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder.  Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.

Corbett is awake.  He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him.  He eyes Wilder's .357.  It's in a lefty Sam Browne
holster.  No way to take it without waking Wilder.

Corbett stands and inches toward the door.  As he pulls it
open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.

Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Goddammit, I don't need this
			aggravation.  I'll shoot you,
			Ben.  Bank on it.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I'm not too old to knock the snot
			out of you!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nothing personal.

Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands
are in front of him.  He reaches for his .357.  Corbett
butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.  Amazingly,
Wilder stays on his feet.

Corbett hurries back to the door.  Wilder lunges,
bull-determined to hold onto him.  Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands.  Wilder goes down
hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there.
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing.  But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module,
Corbett flees.



<b>50   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE
</b>
Eric is pulling on his pants.

<b>51   INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
</b>
Eric rushes in.  The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor.   His holster is empty.  Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder.

Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment, coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle.  Unfamiliar with weapons, Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle.

<b>52   EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Corbett is trying to start Eric's Scout.

Eric fires a loud warning SHOT from the Turtle doorway.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You want to try that handgun
			against this rifle, go ahead.

Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment, weighing his
odds.  He takes his hands off the steering wheel...

Eric SHOOTS again, this time SMASHING the side-view mirror
and window next to Corbett's head.

Still handcuffed, Corbett gets out of the Scout.  Holding
the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the
Scout.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Some day you might have to face
			me without a gun.

<b>53   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric leads Corbett in.  Anne Marie is cradling Wilder's
head. She's crying.  Eric looks at Wilder.  There is blood
coming from his ear and he's fading fast.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(thickly)
			Fetch him back?
			(Eric nods)
			Don't let him walk...

Eric nods again.  Wilder holds his gaze on Eric, then simply
stops breathing.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>53   CONTINUED:
</b>
Eric is stunned.  Quietly, Corbett sits down.  Clutching the
rifle, Eric sits on the floor and glares at Corbett.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(softly)
			Does he have people?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(after a beat)
			A daughter in Oregon.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Send him down to her.  There's
			money in my duffel bag, back at
			his cabin.

Corbett's benign attitude is chilling.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I better call in.

He turns the shortwave radio on.  It SPARKS and burns out.
The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Thought of everything, huh?
<b>					
</b>
<b>					CORBETT
</b>			Surviving is what I know --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- Killing is what you know.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Pack some food while I prep for
			the flight.
			(off her look)
			I'm sure not gonna let him go.

Covering Corbett with the rifle, Eric handcuffs him to the
sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit.

<b>54   EXT.  CACHE, ALASKA - (MOVING SHOT) - NIGHT
</b>
Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt
road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead.

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the
Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's
Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several
taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>54   CONTINUED:
</b>
Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the
streets, drinking and socializing.  With only a couple feet
of snow on the ground, this is still summertime.  Under
storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete.

Viking Bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other
trappers.  He spots their jeep in front of a
dangerous-looking saloon called the "Bear Sign Inn."

<b>ANGLE WITH VIKING BOB
</b>
as he parks and gets out of his station wagon.  He hears a
familiar VOICE around the side of the building.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE (OS)
</b>			C'mon, girl, talk to me,
			negotiate with me...

<b>55   EXT.  CACHE - ALLEY
</b>
Drunk, LeMalle stands in an alley with a bored, acne-scarred
Oriental PROSTITUTE.  He weaves and leers, his hand stuck
inside her blouse.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			LeMalle.  We got a problem.
			Where's Mitchell?
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's
			inside, boring bastard...

Grumbling, Viking Bob separates LeMalle from the Prostitute
and drags him by the collar out of the alley.

</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>56   INT.  BEAR SIGN INN - NIGHT

Meyerling's campaign posters cover the walls.  Many have
been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd.

In a booth covered with grafitti, Mitchell squints and works
on his scrimshaw.  LeMalle, somewhat sober, eats a plate of
muktuk -- whale blubber.  Viking Bob pours him more coffee.

<b>57   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAWN

Wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky.

Eric comes out of the Turtle, leaving the front door ajar.
He throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the Scout.

<b>58   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit.
Terrified about being alone with Corbett, Anne Marie
cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			How long have you been up north?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(after a beat)

Anne Marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but Corbett is
so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite
herself.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			My dad was a Navy doctor.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Knew you had no native blood,

</b>			She's dead.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Oh.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Had some good years.  Met her in
			'66.  She showed up one day in
			Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One
			Sunday morning, she marched into
			a bar and announced she was

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			How did she..?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

Anne Marie shudders.  Smiling good-naturedly, Corbett looks
around, spotting the package Anne Marie's new dress came in.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			What about you -- why come back?
			Classy girl like you seems more
			suited to the finer things.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			That's why I left, moved to

As she's talking, the Turtle ROCKS slightly.  She looks out
the tiny window.

<b>HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW

Eric is putting Wilder's body inside an enclosed storage
compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle.

<b>BACK TO SCENE

Horrified, Anne Marie turns away.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You should know something.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I don't want to talk any more.

He carefully stuffs Wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores
Anne Marie's disparaging look as he does.

<b>60   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK - DAWN

Eric and Corbett drive toward the deserted pumping station.
They cross over a prefabricated steel portal bridge spanning
a fast-running creek.

<b>61   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
The wind whips through the shot-out wing window.  Corbett's
handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon
rope.

<b>62   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
The pumping station consists of three corrugated steel
buildings.  The largest is an airplane hangar.

Just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip
running parallel to the Haul Road.

<b>63   INT.  SCOUT - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric pulls up to the hangar.  Suddenly, LeMalle steps out
from behind the building.

<b>64   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
LeMalle recognizes the International Scout.  He swings his
rifle up to stop it.

Eric slams it in reverse and SCREECHES back around the
hangar.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL (OS)
</b>			Aim for the tires!

LeMalle FIRES as the Scout rounds the corner.  He hits a
fender, doing no damage.  Angry, he runs after the vehicle.

<b>65   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric slams on the brakes and turns the Scout around.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Let me out and keep going.  They
			catch us, they'll kill you.

Eric doesn't need any convincing of that.  He tears out.

<b>66   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of
the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker.  Steam HISSES out of the
radiator.  Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost
hitting him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>66   CONTINUED:
</b>
Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle.  One
of the Scout's back tires gets blown out.

<b>67   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric slows, shifts into four-wheel drive and continues,
driving on the rim.

<b>68   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Chewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to
Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep.  They pile in.

<b>69   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle.

<b>70   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT)

As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it
disappears from sight over a hill.

<b>71   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek.  They come over the
rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed,
below the Haul Road.  Above, the trappers speed past without
noticing.

After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend,
Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back
over the bridge.

<b>72   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Eric stops the vehicle.  He grabs a five-gallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back.

<b>73   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army
Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the
pipeline.  Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and
the honeycombed underside of the bridge.  He puts the rag
inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs
like hell back to the Scout.



<b>74   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
The trappers realize their quarry is missing.  Viking Bob
slams on the brakes and looks around.

<b>75   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric speeds away.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			They'll still catch us.  All
			you're doing is pissing them off.

<b>76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment.

<b>77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
The trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn
around and head toward it.

<b>78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR
</b>
Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip.

With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.

The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a
Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve.

<b>79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank.

<b>80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.

<b>81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from
the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the
water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable.



<b>82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use.

<b>83   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration.
He climbs into the driver's seat.

</b>			Get in.  We can jump it.

They hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start,
REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the
bridge.

As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar
supports crumple.

The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes
airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in
space.

LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth.

<b>84   INT.  HANGAR
</b>
Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip.

<b>85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path.
They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip.

<b>86   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
It picks up speed and takes off.

<b>ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Below, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads.
LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down.

<b>87   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him.



<b>88   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Viking Bob watches, wide-eyed with fury.  Mitchell spits.
LeMalle punches the wall.  Then he turns and repeatedly
BLASTS the Scout, parked nearby, with his carbine.

<b>89   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			How the hell were they smart
			enough to find us?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm
			sitting in this plane and they're
			down there blowing me kisses.

Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure
of the controls.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Been driving long?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I needed a pilot's license to
			take the job here, so I got one
			in six weeks.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			That makes the flight more
			interesting.

Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
landscape all the more immediate.

Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open,
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			See the blood?  Pack of wolves
			took down a moose.  Greedy,
			gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd
			kill the last wolf on earth,
			right in front of the President
			of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly
			predator, the wolf.
<b>

</b><b>89   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Sounds like professional
			jealousy.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hunting and trapping was a damn
			fine life.
			(beat)
			Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,
			we were teams.  I'd always go
			with Mitchell.  Good man,
			Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry
			about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire
			a plane in October.  On the way
			to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
			we'd drop supplies.  We'd land,
			tell the pilot to come back for
			us a few days before Christmas.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			The idea was to get to the
			supplies before the bears did.
			Along the route we'd set our
			traps.  Made our year's living in
			three months.

Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
the tree line.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Lot of times we didn't even have
			a landing strip.  We'd set down
			on a plateau, like that one
			there.  Yeah, that one's easy;
			you could glide right in...

Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot.

The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
jamming it on.

<b>90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is
instantly discharged.



<b>91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.

Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too
fast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hope you got your money's worth
			on those lessons.

<b>92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
plateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau
comes up fast.

The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the
wind.

It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly,
flipping tail over nose.

<b>93   INT.  CESSNA
</b>
It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed.

Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.

Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
wrenching his ankle.

<b>94   EXT.  CESSNA
</b>
Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his
supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett
crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the
plane.

A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the Cessna EXPLODES.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the
powdery snow, clutching at his ankle.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>94   CONTINUED:
</b>
Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he
can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He
lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's
midsection.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay put!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You got the belly to look me in
			the eye and pull the trigger?

Eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Be no different than shooting a
			rabid dog.

The men face off for a tense moment.

Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the
tension.  Letting the hammer down, Eric looks back at the
burning plane.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Next time you want to kill
			yourself, don't include me.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I took the odds on getting down
			in one piece, and I made it.  Now
			we're in my territory.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			With light clothing and no
			supplies, this is nobody's
			territory.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You sound like the tourists.
			Know-it-alls who read about
			survival in a magazine.  Fuck
			you.  You won't make it off this
			mountain.

Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry
to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck
and wraps his ankle with it.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Let's go.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>94   CONTINUED:  (2)
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(re Eric's ankle)
			I'm not gonna carry you out of
			here.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			That's right.  You're not.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Look, take these cuffs off.  We
			need to work together.
<b>					
</b>
<b>					ERIC
</b>			Forget it.

Eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the
sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an
approximation of their direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Last time I checked the flight
			plan, we were forty miles
			northeast of Devil's Cauldron.
			Southwest is that way.  No sense
			waiting for a goddamn taxi.

Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he
shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett
frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his
arms cuffed tightly behind his back.

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett
enjoys the view.  And waits.

<b>95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,
Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,
snow-covered mile behind them.

Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the
rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well
be in a desert.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>95   CONTINUED:

</b>			It'll be interesting, trying to

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Welcome to the environment, Mr.
			Ecology.  Out here, one mistake
			is all you get.

Determined and dour, Eric pushes on.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Why in hell you care enough about
			me to die taking me in?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I don't plan on dying.

It's all academic.  The sheer magnitude of the surroundings
makes them feel they're the only people in the world.
<b>									
</b><b>									DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>96   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK
</b>
The sun drops behind the mountains.  A wind whips up,
chilling the men through their clothing.  Eric tries not to
shiver.  He spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it, making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll stop here, dig out a snow
			shelter.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig.
			I'll have a little sit-down.

Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near
the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every
move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Even in the drifts, this snow's
			too powdery to make a shelter.
			When you're done jerking around,
			reach down the back of my coat.

Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down
through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a
<b>

</b><b>96   CONTINUED:
</b>
folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner
eyeholes.  He shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open...
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>97   EXT.  NYLON SHELTER - EVENING
</b>
Eric and Corbett have stretched the tarp out tent-style next
to the granite rock formation, making a minimal but
functional refuge from the cold night.

<b>98   INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
The men huddle inside the tarp.  Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.  It's swollen to the
size of a softball.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Still quite a hike to Devil's
			Cauldron.
			(beat)
			Days.  A long stretch to go
			without sleep, my friend.  You
			can hide behind that pistol for
			now, but take your eyes off me
			long enough to sneeze --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- Turn around.

While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the
granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning.
<b>									
</b><b>									FADE TO:
</b>
<b>99   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - DREAM  - (AS IN SCENE 3)
</b>
Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit,
following the predator's paw prints in the snow.  He peers
ahead and his prey becomes visible.  But it isn't a wolf,
it's Corbett.  His hands and face are covered in blood.
<b>									
</b><b>									END DREAM
</b>
<b>100  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN
</b>
The sun peeks over the mountain tops, drenching them with
light and color.



<b>101  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
The light hits Eric's eyes.  He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep.  Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.  He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>102  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY
</b>
Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path.  It's simple -- to continue, they have
to cross it.  Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular
hurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the
drop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Ice is too thin -- you can see
			the water moving underneath.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We're not sitting here 'til
			November.  There's a cargo plane
			coming to Devil's Cauldron in
			four days, and I'm putting you on
			it.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			We get wet, we freeze to death in
			a couple hours.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I've been on ice like this when I
			was a kid, skating.  Spread your
			weight, keep moving.  Go on.

Corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by
someone with a Master's Degree.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(gestures 'you first')
			Be my guest.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(points .357)
			I'm right behind you.

Frowning, Corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches
across the fifteen feet to the other bank.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
He turns and, indeed, Eric is right behind him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>102  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Wait 'til I'm across!

Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner.  He keeps
coming.  The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight.

Corbett is three feet from solid ground.  He drops to his
knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the
way.

Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across.  The ice
makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
air holes.

Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.

Eric crawls doubletime.  He makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Eric sits on some rocks.  Corbett glares it him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Most dangerous thing in the
			world: A regular Joe, in over his
			head.  You trying to prove how
			tough you are for me, or for
			yourself?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			It wasn't my idea to crash the
			plane.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Let's camp.  There's grayling
			under this ice. I'll snare some
			for dinner.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(standing)
			We've got another two hours of
			daylight.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Pushing it is flat wrong.  All
			you prove is your ignorance about
			breaking trail.

Eric is not convinced.   Grumbling, Corbett gets up and
takes the lead as they continue southward.



<b>103  INT.  THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY
</b>
Trying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the
darkroom she's made from the front bathroom.  She glances at
her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return.

<b>104  INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
</b>
Anne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up
to dry.  Outside, (OS), a car HORN blares a couple of times.
Grinning, she runs to the door.

<b>105  EXT. / INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up.  Anne Marie comes outside.
Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric.  As Meyerling
climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's
snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I've been trying to raise you on
			the shortwave for two days.

He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Have you talked to Eric?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I have not, but I very much want
			to.  What do you know about the

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I was hoping you had some news --
<b>					
</b>
<b>					MEYERLING
</b>			-- Get this straight: I'm the
			District Supervisor.  Whatever
			you do reflects on me.  It wasn't
			my idea to bring you people up
			here, but I'm stuck with you.
			You are absolutely not to involve
			yourself in any local disputes.
			Whichever side you take, you
			alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett

</b><b>105  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I don't care if Ben Corbett makes

Anne Marie just glares at him.  Meyerling examines the
damaged shortwave.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			What happened here?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			The radio's on the fritz.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Where'd you say Eric is?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Somewhere along the pipeline.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			What about that hotheaded

			was in the middle of this mess.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Sam?  We haven't seen him.

			By the way -- your truck also 'on

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(blanching)
			Why?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			It's out by the pumping station,

Noting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he
crosses to the door.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			Still nothing to tell me?
			(no reply)
			Suit yourself.



<b>106  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
Eric limps further down from the mountains.  Corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum.  As their altitude
decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation.

Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance.  The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated.  Picture the most rustic, overwhelming
wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.

<b>NEW ANGLE - LATER
</b>
The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a
sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear.
Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Have to backtrack, find another
			way down.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Forget it.  It would take days.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(assessing the drop)
			Going to be a bit of a challenge
			with handcuffs on.

Eric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric
cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready,
he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from
Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from
Corbett's tarp.

<b>ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER
</b>
Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon
rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum
footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.

Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path.
Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes
his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold
and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the
dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.

He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger.
Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric
is right above him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>106  CONTINUED:
</b>
Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand
instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.

The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air.
Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his
leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold
of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.

Corbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them
both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst.

After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go
of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the
granite.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>107  EXT.  TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
top of some foothills.  Now and again he glances behind,
gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's
carelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.
Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming
down from the north.

But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.
The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a few
thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
brush to thick coniferous forest.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Better get into those trees
			before that squall blows down.

Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the
foothills.

Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.  They ram
each other with six-foot-wide antlers.

Corbett stares, transfixed, admiring.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You talk about ecology -- there
			it is.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>107  CONTINUED:
</b>
Eric turns, surprised at Corbett's unabashed awe.

Catching the men's smell the moose bound away, and the spell
is broken.

<b>108  EXT.  MINING SETTLEMENT - EVENING
</b>
Viking Bob, Mitchell and LeMalle head somberly back to
Cache.  They drive along a hydraulic gold mining sluice on a
nearby river and come into town.

As the trappers park their jeep, some MINERS greet them,
shouting over the ROAR of the water.

Outside, a STORM rages.  LeMalle is drunk, but still able to

<b>111  EXT.  FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING
</b>
The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures.
Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion.
Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
enemy.  The snow and wind cut through their clothing like
razors.  They poke around for dead wood with which to make a
fire.  The trees are small and healthy; little is found.

			Just gather birch.  It'll smoke
			like hell, but it'll burn green.

Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches
from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed
arms.

They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree
trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm.  Hunching against
the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
pocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so cold
he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.

Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his
hands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takes
the remaining matches from Eric.

Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match
between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holds
the flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fire
immediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against his
fingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takes
hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.

On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.
Eric can't control his shivering.  He gets on his knees next
to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the
wind.  Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not

caring that it's burning his skin.  Finally the fire begins
to grow.  Relieved, Eric and Corbett look at each other with
a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect.

The fire, now unattended, is smoky as Corbett predicted, but
burns along nicely.

</b><b>									END MONTAGE
</b>
<b>112  EXT. / INT.  NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT
</b>
Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.  The STORM
rages outside.  Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner.

Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.  A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.

Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.  Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease.

<b>113  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I need your pocket knife.
			(Eric hesitates)
			I have to eat, too.

After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.  Smiling,
Corbett admires the fancy knife.  Then, BELOW FRAME, he
skins and guts his catch.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Damn lucky this storm didn't blow
			down when we were on those
			baldheaded mountains.  It
			continues, we better stay put.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			It could blow over tomorrow, too.

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You know Meyerling?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss
			your ass with precision if
			there's a vote in it.


Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style.  Raw.  He uses the
knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth,
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice.
Eric stares, disgusted.  Off his look:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Always eat your meat raw when the
			weather's cold.  Does you more
			good, long as the entrails look
			clean.

Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood
from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open,
next to his leg.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'll hold onto that.

With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric.
While Eric eats his dinner, Corbett listens to the STORM and
watches him eat.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Sure love to know where you fit
			in up here.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'm here to do my job.

Corbett smiles -- maybe he's beginning to understand Eric.

</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Folks come to Alaska for a real

			Adventure.  Solitude.  Those

Eric ponders Corbett's words as he eats.

			...John Byers was hospitalized in

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.  Someone is outside.
Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window.

No sign of a vehicle or a person.  As she pulls on her
parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall, but doesn't touch it.

<b>115  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle.  Anne
Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion -- Wilder.  Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
pounds, it's used to having its way.  Right now, it's
hungry.

With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture
the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the

utility compartment.  The bear pokes its head inside, and
Wilder's body slumps out into the snow.  The bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout.  Salivating, it prepares to dig
in.

Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT.
Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked
against the side of the Turtle.  She inches toward it.
Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.

Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys.  They're not there.  She feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares.

Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wields
the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.

The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation
meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat.  As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>115  CONTINUED:
</b>
Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear.  It grunts when
the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards.  Anne Marie
throws another flare.  With a ROAR from hell, the bear
charges.  Anne Marie falls back.  Still holding the last
flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle.

<b>ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground.  The bear
swipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at
the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome.

She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
Turtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't
budge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet
snout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve:
<b>					
</b><b>					?  DANGER!!
</b><b>					
</b><b>					?  BLACK WATER
</b><b>					
</b><b>					?  UNTREATED SEWAGE
</b>
Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort,
it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLING
unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.  Greatly
offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest.

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging
from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.

</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>116  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
</b>
Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center
of three similarly-sized trees.  A FLARE supplies the light.
The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her.

She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground.  Then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>116  CONTINUED:
</b>
She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between
the other two.  She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to
the cross-length rope.

Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches.  The flare
burns out, plunging the area into darkness.

Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to LIGHT another flare.  As she does, the
forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres.
Seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the Turtle.

</b>
<b>117  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAY
</b>
The storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes.  Eric and Corbett trek
toward Devil's Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest.
Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses.  Eric, using a
tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore
ankle.  For the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			There's a cabin, maybe twenty

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

			Too bad we're heading west.

			smart.  Take it and walk away.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(bristling)
			You don't get it, do you?

Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face.  Eric falls
backwards into the snow.  Corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit.  Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.

			Stop!

Corbett bounds through the snow, dodging trees and
snow-covered rocks.

Eric squeezes off a SHOT, and is startled by the recoil and
the blast.  He scrambles to his feet and SHOOTS again.

Corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank.

<b>NEW ANGLE - FOLLOW CORBETT
</b>
Corbett runs over a frozen stream, invisible under a cover
of snow.  Suddenly, the ice SHATTERS under him.  Corbett is
immersed in frigid, waist-deep water.  He gasps from the
sudden temperature drop.

<b>ERIC
</b>
hobbles after him, CUSSING bitterly to himself.

<b>CORBETT
</b>
crawls to solid ground.  Disoriented from the shock to his
system, he rolls over to catch his breath.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric appears over a snowbank.

Corbett tries to run, but his frozen, waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron.  Stumbling and panting, he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream.  Eric easily catches up to him.
Corbett sits in the snow, shivering.  He looks up as Eric
trots over.

Eric glares at Corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nothing personal.  Just wanted to
			see what you'd do.

Noticing Corbett's sopping legs, Eric becomes furious.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

</b>
The sun sinks below the horizon, creating across the
mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows.  The wind
<b>HOWLS.
</b>
<b>119  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter.  Corbett's
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it.  He
huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and
listless.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay awake!  You want to go
			hypothermic?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			If that means freeze my balls
			off, no thanks.
			(yawns)
			I'll be okay.

Eric examines him.  Corbett's skin is white and rigid, his
lips are pale blue.  He scowls at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Told you I'm fine!
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

			How many do you see?

</b>			(irritable)
			What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You don't feel cold?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			It's a spring day...

He starts to doze off.  The shivering he's been repressing
now racks his body.  Eric sits him up, closer to the fire,
and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders.  With his
foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to

Corbett's legs.  Eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't
enough.  Eric loathes the specter of death, even Corbett's.
He shakes him, trying to keep him awake.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Wake up, goddammit!  You've got
			classic hypothermia --
			crankiness, fatigue, can't feel
			your coldness.  Worst thing you
			can do is fade out.

Corbett is headed someplace far away.  Sighing, Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire.  He unbuttons Corbett's
shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett.
Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.  Corbett's
teeth chatter.  He's completely unconscious.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			One more thing -- this doesn't
			mean we're going steady.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
Later, Corbett rests fitfully.  It could go either way.
Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
It's night.  Some color has returned to Corbett's skin.
Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt.  His eyes open.  He tries to sit up, but he's too
weak.

</b>			Stay still.

The AURORA makes a dazzling display in the cold clear sky.
Below, the only light on the endless expanse of dark earth
comes from the Turtle.

Flashlight in hand, wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie
refuels the generator.  Something catches her eye --

In the distance, headlight beams jostle along the Haul Road.

Anne Marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away.

She hurries back into the Turtle.



<b>121  INT.  THE TURTLE

Anne Marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable.

The vehicle gets closer.  It's the trappers' jeep.  It slows
and parks on the Haul Road next to the Turtle.

<b>123  INT.  THE TURTLE

Anne Marie peers out the window.  She gasps as she
recognizes the jeep.  Ducking from sight below the window,
she grabs Eric's coat and hurries into the rear module.

<b>124  EXT.  THE TURTLE

Mitchell stays in the jeep.  Viking Bob and LeMalle get out
and walk cautiously toward the Turtle.

LeMalle stands midway between the jeep and the Turtle,
cradling his carbine.  Viking Bob goes up the steps.

<b>125  INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Anne Marie remembers something she should've taken with her:
the rifle.  Too late.  She hears Viking Bob's FOOTSTEPS (OS)
come up the wooden stairs outside.

<b>126  EXT.  THE TURTLE

Viking Bob knocks on the front door.  He peers through the
sheer curtain on the window, into the front module.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Hullo?

He shrugs to the others, then tries the door.  It's
unlocked.

Mitchell gets out of the jeep, spits and follows the others
in, his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his
leg.

<b>127  INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.  She closes it
behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear
module.

The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is
still warm, etc.  The emptiness is ominous.  LeMalle picks
up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to
determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if

LeMalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around.

<b>NEW ANGLE

In the back, Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow, then climbs into
the utility compartment where Wilder's body was stored.

A moment later, LeMalle comes around the corner.  He notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior night's visit.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(calls out to others)
			Grizzly sign.  Looks fresh.

Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle.  They point
their flashlights around, spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods.

<b>129  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE
</b>
Tense and silent, the trappers follow the marks.  A breeze
RUSTLES the needles of the evergreens around them.  They
stop at the point the footprints end.  A rhythmic CREAKING
above them makes LeMalle shine his light upward.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The light REVEALS Wilder's feet swinging back and forth
above their heads.  His body is suspended in the manner of a
trail cache.  Viking Bob lets out a startled grunt.  He and
Mitchell shine their lights on Wilder's face.

The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at

Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles

and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank.
Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility

He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in.
A pair of eyes stare back at him.

LeMalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife.   He
tries the door again.  It WRENCHES open...

...He's looking at his own face in one of Anne Marie's
mirrored photo reflector boards.

Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment.  Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items
out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the
snow.  Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie,
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment.

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy.  Leaving
the door hanging open, he wanders away.

After he's gone, Anne Marie reaches over and closes the
door.  She can hear the trappers' (OS) CONVERSATION inside:

			answers.  I shouldn't hunt?
			Fine, I'll just phone up and have
			a salad delivered.

Livid, Eric backs away and knocks Corbett's hands away from
him.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Don't push me..!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Cowardly bastard.  I'm in
			handcuffs and I still scare the
			piss out of you.

Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels
back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously
throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into
Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams
his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow.

Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They
wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's
about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			First you save my ass, now you
			want to kill me.  Make up your
			goddamn mind.

</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>134  CONTINUED:  (3)

Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett.  Corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence.

<b>135  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY
</b>
Sunday morning.  Chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the Devil's Cauldron valley.

A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN ("We Will Gather at the
River") plays through a PA system, ECHOING forlornly off the
hills.  The PEOPLE of Devil's Cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement.  Some, older Women
mostly, head for the dance hall, where the HYMN originates.

<b>136  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
The Women SING along with the HYMN.  They face a shelf
holding the PA, a rusty TV and record player.  And, in front
of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit.

<b>137  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON
</b>
The Men, including Neff, split off from their mates and go
into the Maqi.

<b>138  INT.  MAQI
</b>
Neff joins some other Men sweating on benches in the
primitive steam bath.   Kenai sits closest to the fire.  His
thick glasses are steamed up, but he finally looks warm.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Wilder's missing church services;
			you believe it?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			I just as soon he stay gone.
			Fool could've got us all killed,
			arresting Ben Corbett here in
			town.

<b>139  EXT.  FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY
</b>
Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of
foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town
comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from
below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			What makes you so sure my boys
			won't be waiting for us?
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>139  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			They think you're in Fairbanks.
			If not, they still won't find you

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Don't bet on it.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I already have.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You don't know how true that is.

Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll wait here until nightfall.
			No fire, no tarp.

Corbett sits next to him.  After a long moment:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Didn't mean it, you being a
			coward.  You're a lot of things,

			but chickenshit isn't one of
			them.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you
			what scares me -- stumbling
			through life, like an ordinary
			jerk.  That's why I want to work
			on the front lines, where what I
			do means something.
			(beat)
			Soon as I got here, I realized my
			job was bullshit.  Oil company
			propaganda.  I was ready to
			leave, then I thought screw it,
			I'll outsmart them, do the work
			anyway.
			(beat)
			I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am
			fooling myself.  That's what I'm
			afraid of most of all.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hell, I still get a knot in my
			gut every season, wondering how
			much longer I can go on.  No
			'Home for Retired Trappers' that
					-more-
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>139  CONTINUED:  (2)
</b><b>					
</b>					CORBETT (Cont'd)
			I ever saw.  We're like Eskimos
			-- get too old to be useful,
			we're left on the ice to die.

The men listen to the faint MUSIC echoing through the silent
foothills.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; softly)
			My wife used to go to chapel on
			Sundays.  See her friends, 'cause
			I was away so much.
			(beat)
			Should've been home that day.
			She'd be getting dressed right
			about now...

Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses
Corbett's face.

<b>140  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY
</b>
The trappers file out the front door.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			My guess is he's loose and
			heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll
			need supplies; that's the closest
			settlement without a lawman.

LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him
disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the
jeep.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I ain't gonna leave a seven-
			hundred-dollar Remington behind.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(exasperated)
			What you gonna do with it?  Large
			bore's for shit on small game.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Not in the right hands it ain't.

To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip,
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle,
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>140  CONTINUED:
</b>
Pleased, LeMalle slams back the bolt, ejecting a spent
shell.  He glances curiously at the door of the utility
compartment and starts toward it.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(continuing)
			Thought that door was open last
			night...
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Quit fucking around.  Get in.

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob
driving, they pull away.

<b>141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the
window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.

<b>142  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator.
The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on
the rear module of the Turtle.

The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob
hurries on to more important business.

<b>143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE
</b>
As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie
clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb
with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the
flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling
bracket.

<b>144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and
lurches the front module away from the burning rear module.
She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears,
watches the rear module BURNING.
<b>									
</b><b>									DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>145  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</b>
Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen.  They look at one another
-- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago.  No one
seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin.



<b>146  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's dark.  Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not
noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there.  He
blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again.

<b>147  INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE
</b>
Neff pries himself from his MTV to answer a KNOCK at the
door.  Eric hobbles in.  Neff notes Eric's weatherbeaten
condition.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You don't mind me saying, Mr.
			Desmond, you look like hell.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Have you heard anything from the
			girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Not a damn thing.  What's going

			steamed up, looking for you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett
			with me --
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Back at my place... he, uh, broke
			his leg.

<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			If Corbett's men find out --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- I'm putting him on the plane
			to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Jiminy Christmas.
			(beat)
			What do you want from me?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to

<b>

</b><b>147  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I'll go at dawn.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Thanks.  Don't tell anyone you

After Eric goes, Neff closes his door and bolts it.

<b>148  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT
</b>
The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from
the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of
last week seem ages ago.

Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down
for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men
tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches;
bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the
general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from
the others.

<b>149  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling
struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a
roof leak with pitch.  Neff is sullen from his conversation
with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Why the smirk?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Bet I could make some money
			turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe
			more for lettin' him loose.
			(off Neff's flustered look)
			I was up in my cache.  Saw the
			Northland man come talk to you.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You're out of your greedy goddamn
			mind.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Corbett coming here stinks of
			trouble.  We should make the best
			of it before it turns around and
			bites us in the ass.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Stay out of it.



<b>150  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
Eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove.  Corbett watches
from the cot in the cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Talk to that good-looking girl of
			yours?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You broke the radio, remember?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(smiles)
			I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like
			a clever kid.

Corbett sits up as Eric hands him a plate of beans.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			You were real resourceful out
			there.  Got me thinking of this
			perimeter man, froze all his
			fingers one winter.  So he hacked
			the tips off and sharpened the
			exposed bones.  Gets along better
			than ever.  Yeah, maybe I
			underestimated you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I liked you better frozen.  You
			didn't talk so much.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You're damn lucky, glimpsing this
			country before it's ruined, gone
			for good.  You saw wonders you'd
			only dreamed of.  That alone
			makes you different than the
			sorry bastards back where you
			came from, because you have
			dreamt them.

Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Remember that demon in the gut?
			Sometimes it's nothing more than
			wondering if the so-called
			civilized life has bred the balls
			and brains out of you.  That's
			what you want out of this, isn't
			it?
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>150  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			All I want want is you in jail --

A KNOCK at the door interrupts.  Eric lowers the flame on
the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the
cardboard in the front window.  Frowning, he cracks the door
open and slips outside.

<b>151  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's Neff and Kenai.  Neff looks guiltily at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			(explaining)
			He saw you and Corbett come in...
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Dixie's waiting at the infirmary.
			She'll put a splint on that
			injured leg.

Eric is skeptical of Kenai's concern.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Don't let him fool you.  Real
			reason he's here is to buy
			Corbett's traps.

Eric looks at Kenai, then at Neff.  Neff nods that it's
okay.  As extra precaution, Eric handcuffs Corbett's right
wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(to Kenai)
			Okay.  You can talk to him.  But
			I'll keep the keys with me.

<b>152  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
</b>
Outside the wind HOWLS.  Eric enters and walks into the
hallway connecting the bath partitions.  A hand grabs his
arm.  Startled, he turns around.

It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.
<b>					
</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			Earl says you get discount.
			Twenty-five dollar.

Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai.  He gives her three
tens.  She smiles and leads Eric toward the "infirmary."
It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining
table and a first-aid kit.



<b>153  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>

Neff paces nervously.  Corbett smiles at him and Kenai.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			(apologetically)
			Look, Ben, we don't want any
			trouble.  The kid's got the key,
			and besides, he looks edgy enough
			to use that magnum he's carrying.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Relax.  I'll get loose in time.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Any traps you don't want, I'll
			pay cash money.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Guess someone should use them.
			Open the bottom drawer in
			Wilder's desk.  My kit's in
			there.  Might as well unload
			everything.

Kenai tugs on the drawer.  It's locked.  Undaunted, he
jimmies it open with a knife.  Neff groans.  Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.  He checks
for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.  Satisfied, he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars.

With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings:
clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books.
He looks up and shrugs.

<b>154  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
</b>
Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.  His foot rests on a stool.
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a
hot towel draped over his face.  Above him, on a wall
bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.

The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.  She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now
wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.  Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.
<b>					
</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			I wash your back for you.  You
			will like it.

Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again.  It's
Meyerling.  He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and
she scurries away.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>154  CONTINUED:

<b>155  EXT.  CHUKFOKTULIK, ALASKA - NIGHT

Consisting of a handful of sod-roof cabins, mostly bars,
Chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest,
sixty miles southeast of Devil's Cauldron.

<b>156  INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone
WHORE out of her parka.  He's got the motor running for
warmth.  Her gold tooth glints in the light from the
building next to them.  The locating screen on the beat-up
radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS
phosphorescent green.
<b>					
</b><b>					WHORE
</b>			They got nice beds upstairs,
			honey.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I'm standin' guard duty.
			Besides, rather spend the room
			money on sloppy seconds.

Over the sound of LeMalle's exertions there begins an
insistent succession of BEEPS.  The Whore looks over
LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device.
<b>					
</b><b>					WHORE
</b>			Hey, Tiger --

LeMalle turns and immediately loses interest in the Whore.
Pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's HORN three
times.

<b>157  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Eric and Meyerling are in the middle of an argument.

</b>			What does this matter to you?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(sneering)
			You can't see past your lousy
			little assignment, sniffing

			voters there are in this district
			look up to Corbett, and I'm not
			about to alienate them.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I should release Corbett because
			you want some votes?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			This miserable wilderness is a
			state of the union.  Policy's
			made here the same way as in the
			civilized world: at the ballot
			box.  That's the beauty of it --
			these icebox cowboys are living a

			greatest frontier since white men
			stumbled onto the New World.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Some day these people'll wake up,
			and you'll be the first one
			they'll run out of here.

Eric's attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV
screen.  There are three short bursts, followed by three
long bursts.  Something about it is very familiar.
Scowling, he sits up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Shit...
			(to Meyerling; distracted)
			Do what you have to.  So will I.

Eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on.



<b>158  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps.   The
door bursts open and Eric hobbles in.  Gun drawn, Eric
unlocks the cell door.  He rips Corbett's shirt open.
Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the
cot.  Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag
an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.

Furious, he flings it against the wall, smashing it.

Eric shoves Kenai and Neff out the door.

He slams the door.  Corbett smiles his Cheshire smile.

Fat, dry snowflakes pour through the still air.  Gloomy
clouds hang immediately overhead.  Visibility is ten feet;
the temperature is below zero.

<b>162  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's 5:30 AM.  Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops
from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam
cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then
seals it with masking tape.  Watching him from the cell,
Corbett smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Flashbomb, eh?

Eric doesn't answer.  He pulls on a heavy overcoat of
Wilder's.  Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk,
Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.  He puts it and some
speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.

<b>163  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE
</b>
Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall.  He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he
stands motionless in the snow.

Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse.

After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.  He
climbs up into the catwalk.

As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing.  Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway.

Eric's unexpected appearance startles Kenai.
<b>

<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			What's the problem with Sam
			Wilder's place?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Pretty clever:  If the trappers
			got that signal beacon and get
			here in time, Sam's is the first
			place they'll look.  They may
			figure you're waiting for an
			airplane, so you can't stay in
			the shack by the airstrip.  Last
			place they'd expect you is on the
			far side of town.
			(shakes his head)
			I can't afford any trouble --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(takes out all his cash)
			-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And
			if you or anyone else will back

<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI

			Why do this?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			If you have to ask, you wouldn't

<b>NEW ANGLE

Outside, there is the high-pitched WHINE of a snowmobile
(OS) driving into town.  Eric cautiously follows the SOUND.

<b>165  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - CLOSE ON ERIC

He listens as the vehicle cuts across town toward Neff's
house.  The snowfall is too thick to see who it is.  Eric

FOOTSTEPS crunch up Neff's driveway.

<b>WIDER ANGLE - NEFF'S HOUSE

A person in a hooded parka stands on Neff's stoop, about to
knock.  Magnum drawn, Eric suddenly appears from the curtain
of falling snow.  He shoves the person against the side of
the house.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
It's Anne Marie.  She gasps.  Seeing Eric, she's more angry
than relieved.  Eric puts the gun back in his waistband.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Eric!  Why aren't you in

He pulls her away from Neff's doorstep.  Her anger
dissolving, she wraps her arms around him.

			Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four

Sighing, she STARTS the snow machine.  Most of her photo
gear is lashed to the saddlebags.  As she pulls away, Eric
limps back to Neff's house and knocks on the door.
<b>			INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE
</b>
Shaken, Neff opens the door and lets Eric in.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I was just on my way to your
			ladyfriend's, but I guess she
			found you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last
			night.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I'm the one should be sorry...
			Goddamn Kenai, always out for a

			go over there.

</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'd sure like that favor you

Neff gets a seasick look on his face.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count
			on it turning this ugly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			What are you talking about?
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Bastards killed Sam, you think
			they won't kill the rest of us?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			There'll be three, four men at
			the most.  I have some backup,
			nothing will happen.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I'm real sorry.  In a while,
			you're gone from this country.
			But we live here.  No one wants
			to mix it up with those hombres.

Neff opens the door for Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(angry)
			You don't care enough about Sam
			to --
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			-- Sam Wilder was my cousin.
			He's why I came to Alaska.  All
			his letters, saying what a
			paradise it is.  But me ending up
			dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

<b>166  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Anne Marie waits in front as Eric hobbles up.  She looks at
his bad ankle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			You're hurt.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have
			to hurry.

He leads her inside.



<b>167  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Could've told you no one would
			help...

Seeing Anne Marie, he smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; to Anne Marie)
			Maybe you can talk sense into
			your boyfriend.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Shut up!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Anne Marie)

			Either way, you better clear out.
			I don't want anyone innocent
			getting harmed.

This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.  Angry,
Eric throws Corbett a coat.  Corbett puts it on.  Reaching
through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We're moving.  Let's go.

As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver.

<b>168  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a
beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove.  Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream.

Eric checks his watch.  6:15 AM.  He bolts the door and
blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from
outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You'll catch a chill by that dumb
			waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.
			(hands her the .44)
			Keep this pointed at him if I get
			preoccupied.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>168  CONTINUED:
</b>
Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun.  Trying to allay
her fears, Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face.
Corbett intently watches them.  Before he can say anything,
Eric shoots him a cold look.  Corbett stays quiet.

<b>169  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
</b>
A pall hangs over the town.  People know to stay inside.
Time crawls by.

In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.  He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside.

In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.  All the stalls are
empty.

In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow.  Dixie comes up behind him and puts her
hands on his shoulders.  He looks up at her, glum.

In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return.

In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.  10:45 AM.

<b>170  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR WILDER'S CABIN - DAY
</b>
The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases.
The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into
town.  It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a
woodpile across from Wilder's cabin.

The trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's
Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob
carries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.  It's so
cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it
hits the ground.

They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.

<b>ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS
</b>
The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move
closer.  There is no sign of life.  Viking Bob gestures for
the others, now positioned on either side of the cabin, to
crouch down for cover.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(calls out)
			Ben?  Ben Corbett?

No response.  Carbine held at his hip, Viking Bob walks up
to the door and, with a mighty kick, BREAKS it in.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>170  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH WILDER'S CABIN DOOR
</b>
Viking Bob points the carbine at an empty room.  He notices,
however, Corbett's duffel bag on the floor of the cell.

<b>171  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON
</b>
The trappers march through town like an advancing army,
looking for some sign of Corbett.  LeMalle stops to dig
through his pockets for some food.  All he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar.  Viking Bob looks at him
impatiently.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Look, we pull Ben's ass out of
			the fire, I'll get you a whole
			damn crate of Snickers bars.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(insulted)
			I'm right fuckin' here with you.

To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling,
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door.  This proves fruitless, so he lets out a
frustrated YELL.  Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets
off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the
foothills.

<b>172  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor.
Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall.  After a moment of
silence, from outside, not too far away:
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE (OS)
</b>			Ben!  Speak out before I torch
			every dump in town!

Eric points the magnum at Corbett.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Answer and I'll shoot!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You kill me, you sign your death
			warrant.
			(re Anne Marie)
			And hers.



<b>173  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Viking Bob and Mitchell come running over to LeMalle.
LeMalle fires another couple SHOTS for emphasis.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(calls out)
			You hear me?  Ben?
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			Ease off.  We do this my way.

He and the others strain their ears for a clue.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(continuing; calls out)
			Whoever's holding Ben Corbett,
			listen to me: we just want to
			know he's okay.  He is, nobody
			gets hurt.

<b>174  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
His mind racing, Eric stares at Corbett.  Despite the
freezing temperature of the room, he's sweating.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			They know I'm here.  I don't say
			something, they'll plow this town
			under.  You willing to accept
			that responsibility?

Setting his resolve, Eric drags Corbett to the window.  He
pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbett's cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll
			kill you if they rush us.

Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave
front.  Despite the gun in his face, Corbett remains calm.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(shouts through window)
			Bob?

<b>175  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Hearing Corbett's voice, the trappers spin around, trying to
ascertain its direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT (OS)
</b>			Relax.  I got a nervous man here
			with a magnum up my nose.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>175  CONTINUED:

The trappers follow his VOICE toward the rental cabins.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			You in one piece?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT (OS)
</b>			I'm fine.  Look forward to seeing
			you...
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Count on it.

<b>176  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric pulls Corbett away from the window.  He shoots a look
at Anne Marie.  They're in a bind and she knows it.

<b>177  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
LeMalle grabs Viking Bob's arm.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(to Viking Bob)
			Sweet-talk won't get shit.
			(calls out)
			Choose it, asswipe -- cut Corbett
			loose, or soon as you come
			outside, I put a fuckin' bullet
			through your eye!

<b>178  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric glances at Corbett, whose grim look certifies LeMalle's
boast.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Snow's to their advantage, kid.
			You can't see them, but soon as
			that plane comes, they'll sure as
			hell know where we're going.
			Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon.
			I'll give you that money and
			guarantee you'll walk away.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Why offer a buyoff with your
			gunmen waiting outside?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			The time has passed for men like

			That's why they'll kill you.

</b><b>178  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b>					CORBETT (Cont'd)

			Be rude to let that happen after

Anne Marie tries to hide how tempted she is by Corbett's
offer.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(to Eric)
			He's right about the snow.  We're
			blind.

Eric sighs -- is she against him, too?  From outside:
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB (OS)
</b>			Ben?

The trappers are obviously much closer.  Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Eric and Corbett face the window.  They don't notice as Anne
Marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb
waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin.  Eric turns,
gasping as he realizes she's gone.  Corbett smiles
sardonically.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			At least your girl had the sense
			to jump ship.  Too bad she's the
			only one small enough to fit
			through that dumb waiter.

<b>179  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
</b>
Using the cover of the snowfall, Anne Marie circles around
the outside edge of town toward Wilder's cabin.  She takes
some of her photo gear from the snowmobile.

<b>180  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Unaware of Anne Marie's maneuver, the trappers wait for a
response from Corbett.  None comes.  Viking Bob places a
calming hand on LeMalle's shoulder.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Just wait, we don't know what
			this guy's up to.  Ben'll let us
			know what to do.



<b>181  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - ANTENNA TOWER
</b>
With a camera bag slung over her shoulder, Anne Marie climbs
up the metal antenna tower behind Neff's house on the edge
of town. She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of
vertigo. The ground disappears from sight, hidden by the
snow and fog.

Fifty feet up, she attaches her infrared video camera to the
tower crossbars and, using a length of coaxial cable, hooks
its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna.

<b>182  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric looks at his watch.  10:55 AM.

<b>183  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
A CRACKING twig behind the cabins gets the trappers'
attention.  Clutching his rifle, LeMalle goes to
investigate.

<b>WITH LEMALLE
</b>
as he probes through the snow, listening.  He reaches the
edge of the woods and, finding nothing, returns to the
others.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Anne Marie crouches behind a tree, twenty feet behind
LeMalle.  After a moment, she tiptoes back toward the rental
cabin.

<b>184  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft.  Anne Marie wriggles back
inside.  Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers
over his mouth.  She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.  It's Devil's Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.  The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene.  Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes.
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. --
are pink and red.  And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi.  The trappers.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Corbett is amazed.  Eric smiles at Anne Marie.

</b><b>184  CONTINUED:

			Technology in the wilderness.
			Only problem is talking to you on
			your way to the landing strip.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I've got an idea.  We'll have to
			work fast.

He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies,
then stops and looks up.  Outside, there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD.  The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance.

<b>185  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
The trappers look at each other as the SOUND of the plane
grows louder.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			There's what they're waiting on!
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(smiles tightly)
			They'll have to come right past
			us.

<b>186  EXT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric quietly pulls the door open.  Holding the pistol to
Corbett's head, he pushes Corbett out in front of him.

Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look.  Fighting back
tears, she reaches up and touches his face.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			When you ran off, I thought you'd
			keep going 'til you were back
			home in Washington.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			My home is here.  With you.

He smiles.  Then he and Corbett are gone, lost from sight in
the snowfall.   After a beat, Anne Marie takes a deep breath
and slinks away in the other direction, toward the dance
hall.
<b>

<b>ANGLE NEAR THE MAQI

The trappers wait, twenty-five feet from Eric and Corbett.
The DRONE of the plane grows louder.

<b>ERIC AND CORBETT
</b>
start toward the airstrip.  Corbett sees a patch of bare
dirt and SCUFFS his feet in it.

<b>ANGLE NEAR MAQI
</b>
The trappers turn to the SOUND, heard under the RUMBLE of
the still-distant plane.  Converging, they head in that
direction.  Suddenly, Anne Marie's VOICE booms through the
town:
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE (OS)
</b>			(over PA)
			They're moving toward you!

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric SHOOTS a couple times, then backtracks and pulls
Corbett behind one of the rental cabins.

Ducking the bullets, the trappers sprawl onto the ground.

<b>187  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Anne Marie has turned on the rusty TV near the pulpit.
While watching the infrared IMAGE of the action outside, she
holds the microphone wired to the old PA.

<b>ANGLE - THE TRAPPERS
</b>
Viking Bob gestures to Mitchell and LeMalle to separate.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE (OS)
</b>			(over PA)
			They're fanning out.

Angry, LeMalle BLASTS his rifle in direction of her VOICE.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(to Viking Bob)
			Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck
			she seein' us?
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Doesn't matter.  We know where

Stalking, anxious, LeMalle follows Viking Bob.

</b>

<b>MITCHELL
</b>
splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow.

<b>188  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two
buildings in the center of town.  He walks in Corbett's
footprints.  Almost through to the other side, he suddenly
stops.  Pulling Corbett with him, Eric walks backwards,
still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT.
Corbett can't help but smile.

<b>189  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Watching the TV screen, Anne Marie sees one of the red blips
change direction and head toward her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(into mic)
			One is moving back toward the

<b>190  EXT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
It's LeMalle.  He crosses to Kenai's generator.  With a
well-placed rifle SHOT to its innards, he GRINDS it to a
halt.

<b>191  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.  Anne Marie
keys the PA microphone; it's dead, too.

<b>192  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings.  Eric
backtracks toward the hot springs spa, now leaving an
obvious trail.

<b>193  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric and Corbett go inside.  Eric pulls the door closed
behind them, but leaves it ajar.

<b>194  INT.  KENAI'S HOUSE
</b>
The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder.  Kenai
stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters.  Dixie looks
at him.

</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			Earl, it's crazy to go out there.

</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>194  CONTINUED:
</b><b>

He straps on a holster under his sealskin coat.

<b>195  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP - LONG SHOT
</b>
The big 4-prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snow-covered airstrip.

<b>196  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside.

<b>197  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar.
He peers inside.

<b>198  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention.

He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.
He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for
balance.

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a
yelp, he splashes into the water below.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(to Corbett)
			That'll keep him out of the cold.

<b>LEMALLE
</b>
climbs out of the central pool, soaked.   He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down.



<b>199  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa.  A GUNSHOT
rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's
head.

<b>MITCHELL
</b>
has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow.  He
purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.

<b>ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back.   They are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall.

<b>200  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings.  He continues to a point where they converge to
one set, then stop.  He smiles at the naivete of Eric's
ploy.  Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes
Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
boardwalk.  Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues
along the alley.

SNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
back in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle.

<b>201  EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES
carry though the town.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			He'll live.

<b>202  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes
to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob
tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is
broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In
agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding.

<b>203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.
Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>203  CONTINUED:
</b>
in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them.  His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.
Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.
He comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
.44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(gasping)
			Don't make me shoot.

She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.
LeMalle glowers menacingly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			We're going to Sam's cabin.  You
			can stay in the jail until this
			is over.

LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie
wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Want to chance it with that
			hog-leg?  You can't even hold it
			up.  Better drop me first shot,
			bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'
			lungs out.

Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is
paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the Remington.

Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle
close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne
Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,
leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets
her arm fall.

<b>204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN

Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the
worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot.

<b>205  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's
ransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, when
he hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling.

<b>206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot.

As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.
<b>

</b><b>206  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION
</b>
Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming
right for them.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses
it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.

Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash
has temporarily clouded his vision.

Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for Mitchell to move on.

<b>207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still
having trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE

			Over there...

He hoists his Remington.

</b>			(whispers)
			Hold it.  You might hit Ben.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming
			at.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Let 'em come closer first...

But LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up,
left-handed, and SHOOTS.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns
FIRE with the .357.

<b>208  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>208  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT
</b>
as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,
nearby.  Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the
depot.  There is no further movement.

Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward
the depot.

<b>209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over
something.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the
wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.
Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls
him closer.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Glad to see you're okay.  I told
			LeMalle not to shoot.
			(tries to smile)
			Had some fine seasons, didn't
			we...

Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.
Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's
pocket, Corbett picks it up.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Eric)
			Fifteen years on the trail with
			this man, I never saw him rise to
			anger.

Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood,
and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Eric
pulls back.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; bitterly)
			Your first kill.  How does it
			taste?

Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric
stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett
inside.



<b>210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
</b>
The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
removes his Walkman headphones.  Hearing LeMalle's
continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his two-way radio.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			(into radio mic)
			Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just
			touched down in Devil's Cauldron.
			Nobody's here to greet me like
			usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm
			getting scarce.

With that, he STARTS his engines up again.

<b>CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT
</b>
who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
life OS.

<b>211  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
</b>
The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off.  He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly
opens.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			You can't leave yet.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			It's my responsibility to get
			this aircraft out of here safely.

Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			(continuing)
			You got to be kidding.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Leave the engines idling.  Go
			back and open the side door.


Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
and obliges the little lady with the big gun.



<b>212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about.

Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane.

Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goes
for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
forward.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Nobody wants any more killings;
			we all agree to that, correct?
			(no one argues)
			That's good.  Now, Eric, you're
			gonna hand your prisoner over to
			us.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Fuck you.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			This isn't your concern.  It's
			over, here and now.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Meyerling)
			Sure, when you put a bullet in my
			back on the way out.  Easier for
			all involved.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben.
			There's no room in Alaska for you
			any more.

Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-
and bear-spears.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			You're as antiquated as this
			shit.

Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>212  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Keep back.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You're quite a piece of work,
			Meyerling.  The tide changes, you
			ride right along with it.

Eric looks at Neff.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Neff, you know better than
			this...
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.
			Step aside; stay out of it.

Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.  Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed in
blood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
dead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
massive Remington.

He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing
himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.

Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.

Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands, and hurls it.

There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.

LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest.

Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
the muzzle blast.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
There is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,
Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do
anything, Meyerling FIRES.

The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>212  CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp.  Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
and Neff pull them apart.  Eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Anybody moves and I'll shoot!

Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.  Bleeding
from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Can you walk?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Wound's a through-and-through.
			Missed my liver, I think.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Let's get out of here.

Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett
get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.

<b>213  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP
</b>
Anne Marie jumps down from the cockpit.  She and Eric lift
Corbett into the plane.

<b>214  EXT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
as it taxis and lifts off.

<b>215  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
While Eric takes Corbett's handcuffs off, Anne Marie looks
at his wound.  He waves her away.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			How come you didn't let him shoot
			me?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(softly)
			Like I said, I'd still be up on
			that mountain, frozen solid, it
			wasn't for you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll get you to a hospital, soon
			as we get to Fairbanks.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>215  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			So they can patch me up and put
			me in a cage?  Forget it.
			Meyerling's right -- I'm a
			dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like
			him, it's their turn with this
			land.  Put me in the woods, let
			me live or die on my own.

He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; peers out
				window)
			Look down there, tell me what any
			of this matters.  Struggles of
			men get swallowed by the bigness.
			Soon there won't be a trace of
			our troubles... or us.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You're wrong.  Everything we do
			leaves its mark.  You said it
			yourself -- there are hundred-
			year-old footprints in the
			tundra.

Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.
He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it.

<b>EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAW
</b>
The exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a
grizzly beside a wilderness creek, with trees and mountains
in the background.

<b>CORBETT
</b>
clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes.

<b>NEW ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood --
on the back of his hand.  He stares at Corbett for a long
moment.  Then, resolved, he climbs up front and says
something to the Pilot.  Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts his
controls.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>


<b>216  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - PUMPING STATION - DAY
</b>
The snow clouds are dissipating.  The cargo plane comes down
through them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumping
station.

<b>217  INT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
As it rolls to a stop, Eric throws open the cargo door.
Corbett sits up, surprised.  He and Eric exchange a long
look, then Corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly
steps down onto the snow-covered runway.

<b>218  EXT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
Eric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane as
Corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline.  As he
goes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.

Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continues
onward, disappearing into the forest.

<b>ANGLE ON CARGO PLANE
</b>
Eric closes the cargo door as the Pilot turns the plane
around and taxis back down the runway.

<b>219  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.  She kisses him.

The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			(to himself)
			Too damn crazy in this state
			anymore.  I'm moving back to L.A.

<b>220  INT.  CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,
ice blue sky.  It banks and turns south.  Behind it, the
mountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.
