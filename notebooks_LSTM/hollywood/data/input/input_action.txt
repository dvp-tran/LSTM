<b>          JANUARY 31, 1981
</b>          Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light
          spills in and we see.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC -

          Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost
          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and
          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY
</b>                         
          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
                         
          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
          the head and no words.
                         
          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is
          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.

<b>          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA
</b>          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
</b>                         
          STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank.
                         
          The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Good morning.
                         
          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
          smile.
          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
                         
          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
          masks. It's very brazen.
                         
          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-
          link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL:
          WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.
<b>                          4
</b>                         
                         
          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not
          want to cross this woman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Ready?
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You look very nice.
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Thank you.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You sure?
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
          empty briefcases.
                         
          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document.
                         
          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
          heavy cases to ABEL.
                         
          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck. He turns to ANNA.
                         
<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't do anything stupid.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           We don't have any more money so
           what else could I do.
                         
          She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
<b>                          5
</b>                         
                         
          ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. He gives a nod
          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,
          and he begins to open the front gate.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. He
          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands
          looking into the neighboring site.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW
          WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
          The place is rusting and could use some work.
                         
          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           So how are we this morning?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           (gives a smile and nod)
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well I woke up feeling very good
           about this.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Really?
                         
          They both take a look at their watches.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You've been telling me not to do
           this for a year.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well we are going all in... so now
           I love it.
                         
          Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward
          silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls
          into the lot.

<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Here we go.
          And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. There are two guys
          in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid-
          to-late seventies. They all shake each other's hands then
          stand around for a beat.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Should we head inside?
                         
<b>          INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
</b>                         
          The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer. ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them. Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH
          MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. His accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Almost two.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           There are many like it around? And
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for, we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above. My people have looked at
           your books, I know this is a lot of
           money for you, so why have you kept
           on us so... just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I have been looking over my fence

           time.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

</b>           No... I imagine I want it for the
           same reason you did.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

</b>           To grow.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Well, I am in the garment business
           so I appreciate that sentiment. But
           I inherited this land from my
           uncle. Sadly he had no children of
           his own. He was the one that let
           them build these tanks here. So
           this place can do little for me...
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           you've done it may be a liability.
           As you know I offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price, but
           you were not interested?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Why not?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I like to own the things I use.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

           you is because of the favorable
           terms of this contract. So this is
           business... and when you sign
           this....

          ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
          black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven
          hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to
          their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake
          hands.

          He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
          watch.

          Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under
          construction, appears. He pulls up in front.
                         
          He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large
          house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that
          it is nearing completion. It is empty.

          ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick

          looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
          to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
          exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately.

          places him back down on the table.

          They look each other over. She then finally leans in and
          gives him a caring kiss, she walks off.

          He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital

          They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up

          The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in
          the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down
          at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea.

           around in this city, just trying to
           do their jobs. And I... I have done
           everything you have asked of me.
           It's been two years since you first
           started investigating my company
           and I have spent thousands of
           dollars hiring lawyers for this and
           that to provide you with every
           piece of information your office
           has requested. And I expect that
           you have been asking the same from
           my competitors. So with all this
           information that you have gained...
           We are just asking if you have any
           idea who has been doing this to us?

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I understand your frustration. And
           although everyone else seems to
           have given up and left this city
           for dead, I haven't. And as you
           know we have been investigating
           industry-wide corruption in your
           business that seems to have been
           going on for years. And the simple
           fact is that the only person who
           could do anything with 8000 gallons
           of heating oil in a matter of
           minutes after stealing a truck is
           someone from within that industry.
           And almost certainly someone with
           local storage capacity. So you're
           right. That means you all are
           stealing from each other. Which is,
           as far as I can tell, just a
           refreshing new take on what you've
           been doing to your customers and
           fellow taxpayers for the last
           fifteen years.
                         
          This sits in the room for a long beat.
<b>                          ABEL

           the work you are doing to try to

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Well yes and no. See, all that I

           away in the simplest and most
           economical way possible with the
           limited resources at my disposal.
           It doesn't really matter to us who
           it is or how we do it as long as
           it's progress.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, it makes a difference to me.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know it does. This city is a very
           difficult place to do business
           right now.

          next reply for a long beat.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           You know... Mr. Morales you seem
           like a decent man, and because of
           that I'm really not comfortable
           just sitting here with you
           pretending that the elephant
           perched on the corner of my desk
           isn't there.
                         
          LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says
          `don't go down this road'. But he does.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I can't go into specifics at this
           moment but we believe that you and
           your company have broken the law
           and that we have enough evidence to
           prove that. So next week, Monday
           actually, we will be bringing a
           case against you.
                         
          This drops like a bomb. ABEL and LAWRENCE stare at each
          other. Then ABEL glances to the corner of the desk. We see
          that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting
          there. ABEL looks back up.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry to do this in person.
           It's awkward, obviously, but I
           didn't want to have this happen on
           Monday not having said something
           here in person today, out of
           respect.

          ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned
          but stands.

          ABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. It is now dark
          outside.

          ABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods.
          He runs along the road. We then hear a car coming from behind
          him. The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. He
          stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards
          him.
                         
          He gets himself over to the side of the road. We have a
          slight fear it might hit him. But as it passes we see it's a
          large moving truck. There's a second one following right
          behind it.

          As the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. He cuts into
          a path in the woods.

          ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks
          preparing to unload. ANNA gets out of her car with the kids,
          and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs
          the movers.
          ABEL comes up and stands next to her. They smile a protected
          smile at their new home. ABEL gives her a kiss.

          The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. They
          are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and
          everyday tableware that has been unpacked. There are boxes
          all around them.

          ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee

          ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the
          sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to
          the side from everyone else.

           we've been taking. We haven't had
           an incident since November. It
           doesn't do any of us any good to
           have this kind of attention brought
           to us.

<b>          INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY
</b>                         
          The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of
          a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio
          in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York
          Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the
          boxes and looks at it with significance.
                         
          Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S
          oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
                         
<b>                          ANNIE

          ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there.
          He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost
          to the ceiling around them.

          This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the
          door to the house and calls for his wife.

          ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the

          pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new
          item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then
          stops in silence.

          ABEL is lying in bed, awake. ANNA is as well. He is staring
          at the ceiling. Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed
          asleep as well. Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out
          towards the doorway. He growls ever so lightly. Then he
          stops, listens, and starts growling a little more.
                         
          ANNA looks up ever so slightly.

<b>          INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall
          to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is
          sleeping soundly with nothing out of place.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME

          As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he
          sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down
          over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to
          quietly growl once again.
                         
          ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to
          total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off
          in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy
          club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying
          not to freak himself out.

</b>                         
          ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the
          top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the
          living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then
          relaxes and turns towards the dog.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

           here.
                         
          He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes
          down the stairs.
                         
          ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but
          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the
          windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the
          front door but the dog refuses to go out.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Go. Oh come on. Go.
                         
          ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and
          pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside.

<b>          EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing.
          The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading
          over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side
          entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy.
          ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway.
                         
          All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes
          blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he
          goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the
          shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs
          towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster
          than we expect.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running
          full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping
          up with him and in fact may be gaining on him.
                         
          ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been
          building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now
          pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down.
          They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to
          know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of
          an easier/quicker path down.

</b>                         
          ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his
          legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings
          at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is
          exhausted. They stare at each other.
                         
          A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is
          up again and running off into the woods.
                         
          ABEL gets himself up and chases after him.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT
</b>                         
          ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and
          in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with
          its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger
          side of the van, and it peels out.
                         
          ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able
          to breathe and holding the bat.

          standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next
          to her. She looks at him in shock.

          They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some
          kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are
          cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice.
          His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.

          ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has
          disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly
          seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting
          bandages on them as they talk.

          She looks at him with considerable concern.
                         
          He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first
          then gives in.

          ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his
          back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking
          for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element.
          He is a salesman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

           the opening to the burn chamber.
           Now at this point you have not
           tipped your hat in anyway. From the
           minute you walked in the house you
           should have been working to create
           an impression of total
           impartiality. But now...
                         
          He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning
          inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white
          handkerchief.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           When this door opens you begin to
           close. It must always be spotless.
           If they see you have ever done this
           before it is over.
                         
          He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney.

           slowly just start shaking your

</b>           It means you are close... Then
           after sitting in silence way longer
           than is comfortable, you turn. And
           say "I'd love to run a few numbers
           for you. Is there somewhere more
           comfortable we could sit." They
           will almost always take you to the
           dining room table and will offer
           you something. And whatever it is
           you always take the fancy option.

           them what we can save them over the
           long haul through proper
           maintenance, you need them to sign.
           And the problem is by hiring you
           that means they are firing someone
           else. And that's never easy. So to
           get them over the line you need to
           close them. So when you show them
           the number look up at them both...
           and just stare at them...
                         
          ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You stare longer than you should.
           Because this is not a joke. You
           will only keep this job if you
           close. And that's not funny to you.
           And I am only interested in this
           company growing, and when it isn't
           I don't think it's funny at all.
           These people work very hard for
           their money and these other guys
           are ripping them off, treating them
           poorly, because they don't know...
           so when you look them in the eye
           you have to believe that we are
           better, and we are, but you will
           never do anything as hard as
           staring a person straight in the
           eye and telling the truth.
                         
          ABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a
          long beat.

          There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the
          company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are
          impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the
          drivers have company meetings is very basic.

          The room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit
          of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in.

          stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps.

          ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the
          day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees
          the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and
          CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house.
          CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with
          something in her hand.
                         
          ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the
          house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look
          then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer
          to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.

          As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl
          is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little
          hands. ANNA is besides herself.

</b>           We need to sit down with them
           immediately. I set a dinner. We
           need you both there to lay
           everything out and be totally up-
           front. This shouldn't be a problem.
           Lord knows they've given money to
           bigger crooks than us. But I don't
           want us hiding anything from them.

           So let me think this through. But
           whatever decision I make on this,

           it always does. And if you want

           stay in business long enough it's
           bound to happen eventually.

</b>           Well that's exactly right. And we
           wanted to sit down with you tonight
           to make sure we were being totally
           up-front with everything that is
           going on and make sure that you
           understand the nature of the
           complaints and are comfortable that
           it is not going to affect our
           business in an adverse way.

           pay off any and all fines and be
           able to move forward with very
           comfortable capital on hand.
                         
          ABEL jumps in taking some offense.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           But you should know Arthur that
           this man has been digging through
           our industry for over two years
           looking for anything he can find.
           And as you know probably better
           than anyone, having worked with
           some of our competitors the thought
           that he would have singled us out
           is ridiculous. It reeks of
           everything that is wrong with this
           city right now. We run a fair and
           clean business and follow every
           standard industry practice and I
           will fight `til my last day to
           prove that...
          This silences the table for a long beat.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)

          ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the
          table to make his point.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           ...Don't think for a moment that I
           am going to allow this mess to
           interfere with our plan to grow. We
           need to know you are standing by
           us.
                         
<b>           BANK VP IAN THOMPSON
</b>           Yes, what is it with this piece of
           property that you find so integral
           or that can't be put off `til after
           this legal matter is dealt with?
                         
          ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against
          everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and
          ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off.
                         
          ABEL thinks it through.

</b>           That's a very good question. This
           property gives us many things...
           firstly direct access to the river.
           So I can bring in fuel directly
           from any provider in the world
           straight to my tanks, then it has
           over 10 million gallons of storage
           capacity, so I can buy in the
           summers when my price is low and
           sell to my customers and most
           importantly some of my competitors
           when the price is high. I won't
           just drive trucks anymore... I will
           control my fate... but the real
           answer to your question...
                         
          Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           ... is that when it feels scary to
           jump Ian... that is exactly when
           you must jump... or you risk ending
           up staying in the same place your
           whole life... and that I can't do.
          IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly
          serious staring right at him. Finally.

          ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the
          passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods
          road to their house.
                         
<b>                          ANNA

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes. Arthur is a good man.
                         
<b>                          ANNA

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Of course.

          Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of
          them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop
          in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the
          windshield and on to the road behind the car.
                         
          He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete
          stop.
                         
          They both catch their breath and look around to make sure
          they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is
          laying on the road but is still breathing.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)

          ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He
          then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on
          the side of the road.
                         
          He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares
          back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.

          He reaches down to open the trunk.

          This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on
          edge.
                         
          ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He
          walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and
          stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on
          something, or many things.
          He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it
          over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it.
          Then he sits with the animal a beat longer.
                         
          We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling
          to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron
          waiting... BANG! BANG!
                         
          Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder.
          He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands
          there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special-
          style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the
          pistol. The deer is dead.
                         
          He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun?
          She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car.
          He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road.

          ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps
          as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in
          without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in
          silence.

          The door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the
          house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting.

          NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is
          just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod.
          ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting
          in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and
          gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building
          like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and
          walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each
          other.

          ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure
          what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the
          room from each other. He just waits... finally.

          This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as
          if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer.

          JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to
          feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to
          clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something.
          In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of
          a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks
          over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up.
          Again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN

          He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab.
          He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are
          still coming for him.
                         
          The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a
          long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under
          his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to
          know what he is doing with it.
                         
          But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the
          gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO
          sees him and is very surprised and stops.

          People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk.
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on
          the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by
          mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way
          and is hiding behind the wheel.

           hurt someone.
                         
          JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in
          front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow-
          motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The
          two THUGS now have their guns out.
                         
          The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic
          is backing up.
          Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries
          to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly
          fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that
          forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN
          to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main
          section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating
          oil starts pouring out onto the roadway.
                         
          Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the

          all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying
          to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by

           about four more flights. Don't go
           out there, that's the street. Go
           down about two more flights after
           that and you'll come out below the
           bridge. They won't be there.

</b>           You're welcome.
                         
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his
          feet flying down the steps again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs
          again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN
          heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet
          getting lower and lower.

          JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. We can hear
          sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. He
          keeps going.
                         
          Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another
          doorway. JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. He
          listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his
          own breath.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY

          Then we hear the door back up top fly open. JULIAN then
          quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of
          his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him.
          He looks around, and after a second to get himself
          orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there
          are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening.

          JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the
          gun out in the open. He puts it away and then looks up at the
          bridge that is hovering above him.
                         
          He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge.
                         
<b>           FADE TO BLACK.
</b>                         
          Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large
          truck. It gets louder and louder.
                         
<b>          INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY
</b>                         
          We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty
          construction dumpster. And as he looks around, we realize it
          is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty
          fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise
          inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his
          senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the
          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.
          He is trapped.
                         
          Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
          a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It
          stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end
          of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher
          our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide
          towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he
          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
          open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't
          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.
                         
          As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the
          edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,
          into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to
          stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks
          around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. The house
          is massive and designed like an English Country Estate.
                         
          As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing
          against an automatic tennis ball machine. He is in full
          tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine.
                         
          ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat.

</b>           Peter.
                         
          This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on
          ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer
          to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE

</b>           I see that.
          PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points
          over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down.

           house.
                         
          ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading
          PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER
          had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks
          back at him with a very strong poker face.

          LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says
          nothing, just waiting.

</b>           You should. And when you do, bring
           him to us. A situation like this,
           happening in such a dangerous and
           public way, within an industry I'm
           charged with cleaning up. It's very
           bad for me... professionally
           speaking.

          SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking
          terrible. His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is
          scared. As he approaches his car his face drops.
                         
          The car has a two-by-four slammed through the shattered
          windshield.

          and scans the street looking for anything. It is eerily
          empty.

          does we see ARTHUR LEWIS standing waiting next to his car.
          ABEL pulls in next to him and gets out. There is an
          overriding, almost unsettling calm to this conversation.

          The banker gets into his car and backs out. The gate opens
          and he drives out. Just as it is about to close it starts
          opening again. SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car
          trashed. He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL.
          He knows what has happened and is crushed. Neither of them
          say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but
          meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside.

</b>           No... I'm not... They're out.

          to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops
          him.

          ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the
          passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA
          and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge
          of anger mixed into the sadness.
                         
          The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room
          in the back seat.

          ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit.
<b>                          ANNA

          ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives
          CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks.

          Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls
          the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone
          in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic
          highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence
          still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by
          right next to them.

          ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around
          the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway.
          He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE
          from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the
          traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the
          entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his
          daughter bears the brunt.

          this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up
          in her face.

           option for me. I lived in
           reality... not whatever this world

           people stay warm... which isn't all

           Maybe you've got grander ambitions
           but for now this is how you eat,
           sleep, and get all dressed up... So
           you better shape the fuck up and
           NEVER speak to me like this again!

          The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the
          sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come
          through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk
          in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it
          crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he
          looks exhausted.

          gets in the front seat. JULIAN gets into the back and looks
          over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. They drive off and

          couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be
          getting rubbed out.
          Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. The car pulls
          up to them and stops. ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car
          without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now
          gives him a total debrief.

          them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his
          eyes in sadness.
                         
          With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to

<b>          EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES
</b>          We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase
          continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to
          a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to
          this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across
          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning.
                         
          As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed
          sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his
          fear turns to... anger.

          He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building
          wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry,
          but then it again becomes something else. His survival
          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become
          of it. Anger.

          down the hallway all alone then stops. He reaches into his
          briefcase and takes out the offer. He looks it over again.

           because he is a very talented young
           man. But there are some decisions
           that you cannot come back from. I
           need to know where he is. And I
           need him to turn himself in. His
           actions are hurting me and my
           business. And I refuse to let other
           people's weaknesses hurt me. I
           don't know how it has come to this,
           but it has. If he does the right
           thing I will help to take care of
           his responsibilities. You and your
           family. When you see him. Tell him
           this. Please.

          And with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet
          where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the
          front door with ABEL chasing him.
                         
          He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL
          follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless.

          ABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees
          LUISA standing there in the hall. He walks back up to her in

          This sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts
          back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response.

</b>           But over the last six months
           110,000 gallons of fuel has been
           stolen from my family and I. Now
           the reason we asked Bill to get you
           all here is because the people in
           this room are the only people
           within two hundred miles of here
           who have the ability to purchase
           and store that kind of quantity.
           So... no matter what bullshit you
           have been telling each other one of
           you... or two... or three... has
           been allowing this to happen by
           buying this from these cowards or
           worse yet hiring these guys just to
           do it. And profiting from it. So
           what I am saying is... Stop! Now.
           Have some pride in what you do and
           stop.

          drivers who are out. They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens
          Expressway in stop and go traffic.
                         
          Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio.

</b>           Eddy? Eddy?
                         
          ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this
          is going down right down the street from them. He's had
          enough.
                         
          He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. He
          comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the
          truck comes flying by.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of
          the road. But he wants to end this. So he pulls out and
          starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind.
                         
          ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the
          industrial neighborhood. He is tempted to pull up alongside
          of it to see who is driving but doesn't. He continues to
          follow him.

          They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn
          and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in
          the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is
          following him. It now turns into a high speed chase as the
          driver steps on it.
                         
          They race down a ramp into a railyard. ABEL chases the truck
          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned
          tunnel. The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. The
          truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult
          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up.
                         
          The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car
          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the
          tunnel.
                         
          The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through
          the dust but we can't see the truck. As ABEL comes into the
          light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has
          flipped over in front of him.
                         
          As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down
          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ABEL
          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has
          been killed. There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck
          and ABEL looks and thinks. He then picks up the gun and
          chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
          In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and
          head up into an elevated subway station.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

          ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a
          leaving train just as the doors shut. ABEL looks around.
          There are three people in his car. It is covered in graffiti.
          He starts making his way down to the end of the train where
          the guy is.
                         
          He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just
          bull rushes him to the ground. He starts beating on him very,
          very badly with the pistol. All the rage comes out of him. He
          then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO

<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
</b>           This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
          ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun
          and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up
          and looks back at ABEL.
                         
<b>           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
</b>           Thank you.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens.
          ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks
          around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the
          car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him.

</b>           I'm sorry. You gave me a very good
           chance. Right?
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Probably a better chance than I
           deserved.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Please take care of my family.

</b>           Julian.

</b>           Please...
                         
          ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I will.
                         
          With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and
          pulls the trigger.
                         
          The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side
          of the fuel tank that is behind him.
                         
          ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside
          themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices
          that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid
          the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out
          through the bullet hole onto the ground.
                         
          ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He
          picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the
          hole plugging the flow of oil.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH

          ABEL turns and looks back at him.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           We call the police.

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes!
          With that he walks off behind the tanks.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT, NEXT TO THE TANK FARM SITE - DAY
</b>                         
          There are now POLICE VEHICLES everywhere. ABEL is standing
          off alone. The DA gets out of a car all alone and walks over
          to ABEL.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I did.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           He must have been under a hell of a
           lot of pressure.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yeah. For a while I thought he

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I'm sorry.
                         
          They look out across the city.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I was right there... I couldn't

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Probably not.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, thank you for coming. I
           wanted to make sure this was
           handled correctly.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Of course.

</b>           Yeah.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           So... I should tell you that I
           won't be able to take that deal you
           offered. There is no way I would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything we've done.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I am not a felon.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That's probably true.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           But I also can't have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years. I love fighting a good
           battle but this... it's very bad
           for my business.
                         
          This gets Lawrence's attention.
<b>                          130
</b>                         
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           So, we need to come to some sort of
           conclusion.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           We can probably do that.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Good.
          They both look out for a beat.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I hear you closed on this terminal
           today?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It looks that way.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I didn't realize that you had that
           in the works.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           For a very long time.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That will put you in quite a
           powerful position.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Within my business it has that
           potential.
                         
          LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           If you get this place up and
           running again it will have
           significant influence...
           politically speaking.
                         
          ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down
<b>          LAWRENCE.
</b>                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           We all have our ambitions.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
          LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses.
<b>                          131
</b>                         
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           And sometimes we need help to get
           there... You've come a very long
           way.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes, I have.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           In a very short time.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It doesn't feel that way... But
           please know that I have always
           chosen the path that was the most
           right.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           The most right?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That one makes my head hurt a
           little.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           The result is never in question for
           me. Just what path do I take to get
           there. And I have never questioned
           my path. There is always one that
           is most right. And that is what
           this is.

</b>           I hope so.
                         
          They look at each other and then out over the city.

		Screenplay by John Fasano

"But how will you die when your time
comes, Narcissus, since you have no
mother?  Without a mother, one cannot
love.  Without a mother, one cannot die."

			- Hesse





<b>ALIEN III
</b>

<b>THE SCREEN IS BLACK
</b>
A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

<b>GLASS FURNACE
</b>
The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

<b>A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS
</b>
Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

<b>GLASS FACTORY
</b>
Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

<b>SMOKE
</b>
Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

<b>A MAN
</b>
On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

<b>MORE MONKS
</b>
By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

<b>ONE PARTICULAR MONK
</b>
Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

<b>			BROTHER KYLE
</b>	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

<b>BROTHER JOHN
</b>
Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

<b>		       BROTHER KYLE
</b>		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

<b>		      BROTHER JOHN
</b>		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

<b>		     BROTHER JOHN
</b>		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

<b>		     BROTHER KYLE
</b>		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

<b>			     JOHN
</b>		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

<b>		     BURNED MONK
</b>		But John --

<b>			     JOHN
</b>		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

<b>	   	            JOHN
</b>		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
<b> 
</b><b>		            JOHN
</b>		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

<b>			BURNED MONK
</b>		Thank you, John.  I --

<b>			   JOHN
</b>		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

<b>			  KYLE
</b>		Good work.

<b>			  JOHN
</b>		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

<b>  			  KYLE
</b>		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

<b>INTO THE HALLWAY
</b>
The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

<b>			KYLE
</b>		The Abbot will be pleased.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Don't.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Don't what?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You don't, but thanks anyway.

<b>AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY
</b>
A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Not coming down?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

<b>THE STAIRWAY
</b>
A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

<b>ONE FLOOR UP
</b>
A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

<b>IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM
</b>
An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

<b>INT. LIBRARY
</b>
A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

<b>A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP
</b>
In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

<b>IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY
</b>
John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

<b>			PHILIP
</b>		Brother John.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Brother Philip.

<b>			PHILIP
</b>		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

<b>			PHILIP
</b>		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Perfect.

They move into the library...

<b>THE MEDIEVAL SECTION
</b>
The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

<b>AT THE SHELVES
</b>
John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

<b>			VOICE O/S
</b>		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Father, I --?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

<b>INTO THE BELL TOWER
</b>
The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

<b>THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY
</b>
Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

<b>THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT
</b>
The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

<b>THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV
</b>
Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

<b>ONE OF THE STARS
</b>
Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Brighter still.  Closer.

<b>MORE MONKS
</b>
Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

<b>			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
</b><b>			-----------------------
</b>			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

<b>ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON
</b>
Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

<b>INTO THE SEA
</b>
<b>WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
</b>PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

<b>ON THE SEA - DAWN
</b>
The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

<b>NEXT TO THE HATCH
</b>
A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
<b>WUORRRSH -!
</b>Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

<b>			KYLE O/S
</b>		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

<b>THE OTHER MONKS
</b>
Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

<b>WHOOSH-CLANG -!
</b>The door closes behind him.

<b>INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY
</b>
Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

<b>NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE
</b>
A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

<b>			COMPUTER VOICE
</b>			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

<b>IN THE TUBE
</b>
There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

<b>THE FLOOR
</b>
Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

<b>LIGHTS
</b>
Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

<b>ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN
</b>
LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

<b>A VIDEO MONITOR
</b>
Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

<b>			WOMAN
</b>		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

<b>SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
</b>Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

<b>HSSSSSSSSS -!
</b>A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

<b>ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!
</b>
Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

<b>A WOMAN
</b>
The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

<b>THE DOOR
</b>
Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		This is forbidden.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY
</b>
Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

<b>			FIRST MONK
</b>		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

<b>			KYLE
</b>		You shouldn't have gone in --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		She could've been lost.

<b>			FIRST MONK
</b>		Been a long time since I saw either.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

<b>			KYLE
</b>		What was it like in there --?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Lights.  So many lights --

<b>			THIRD MONK
</b>		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		It's evil.

<b>			FIRST MONK
</b>		It's just technology.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

<b>			THIRD MONK
</b>		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Just lights?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		See?  Just look at the fish.

<b>			THIRD MONK
</b>		The Abbot will know.

<b>			SECOND MONK
</b>		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

<b>JOHN
</b>
He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

<b>THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV
</b>
Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

<b>						GO TO BLACK...
</b>
<b>INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

<b>EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK
</b>
The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

<b>JOHN
</b>
Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</b>
Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

<b>EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY
</b>
A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		How is the woman, John?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

<b>HER POV
</b>
Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

<b>WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING
</b>
With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What the hell --?

<b>SUDDENLY --
</b>The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

<b>ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY
</b>
Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Who are you?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Ripley.  How did I get here?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Where is here?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Can I use a radio to --
<b>	
</b><b>			ABBOT
</b>		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		There was a little girl with me --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You were alone.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

<b>			RIPLEY	
</b>		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		What came with you?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Almost two days --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
<b>	
</b><b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Continue.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Not possible.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
<b>	
</b><b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I have had enough for now.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

<b>THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What is it -- What's wrong?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		But I.  Her meals --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Nobody.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


<b>THE LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
<b>WHAM!
</b>The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What?!

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Huh?  A woman?

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

<b>INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT
</b>
A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

<b>			JOHN
</b>		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

<b>A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE
</b>
<b>			JOHN
</b>		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		What is it?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

<b>BAAA-AAAH!!!
</b>The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

<b>			HYSTERICAL MONK
</b>		What?!  WHAT?!

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
<b>THE EWE EXPLODES ---!
</b>
Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

<b>A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER
</b>
BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

<b>JOHN
</b>
Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

<b>EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Idiots...I'll --

<b>WHAM!
</b>The door BURSTS OPEN --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

<b>			ABBOT V.O.
</b>		An evil has come to Arceon...

<b>IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You heard Brother Graham tell of the
		devil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		An evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		This can't be happening.

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		You have no voice in this tribunal.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You must listen to me!  You're all in
		terrible danger!  It came with me on
		the ship --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		We know that.  At first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen.  But it has only
		brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		Evil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to
		destroy our planet, as surely as it
		destroyed the Earth.

<b>			MONK IN AUDIENCE
</b>		Destruction!

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all 
		still there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		    (matter of fact)
		All dead.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (screams)
		It's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You could not have been on the Earth a
		year ago, because there is no Earth to
		be on -- for at least twenty years.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I haven't been floating in space for
		twenty years.  Let me get to my ship
		and I'll prove it.

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		No.  Who knows what new evils she'll
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine.

<b>			MONK IN AUDIENCE
</b>		No!  Don't let her!!

<b>			TRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>		This woman is a danger.  She denies The
		New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must
		have stowed away on my ship -- must have
		killed --
			(swallows hard)
		Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.
		You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like
		an egg - grows -
			(mimes)
		Explodes out of you - keeps growing into
		some sort of monster.  Kills you --
		Kills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Who are you people?  Look at you -- all
		of you -- the way you're dressed.  This
		isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --
		on a artifical planet.  What are you
		doing out here?

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Isn't there anyone here who will
		listen?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (defeated)
		I guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Then there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		   (to Ripley)
		The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
		To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
		your soul.

<b>						SLAM CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY
</b>
A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You won't be able to fight it...
		You don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You've sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

<b>THE TRIBUNAL ROOM
</b>
Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		...they'll have started before she gets
		down to the Hermitage level.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		No trouble?

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		Only finding the wood for the ship.  But
		Anderson's hut was about that big, and
		he's dead three months now.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
		next winter.  Well, we might not get to
		the winter if we don't take care of this.
		By winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

<b>			ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		The wood isn't going to last forever.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Neither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Go ahead.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Yes, and you did a good job.  You
		shouldn't feel responsible.  You
		couldn't have known --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
		there may be something to what she says.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		There isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I don't understand what you are doing.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		This colony is my responsibility.  I am
		protecting the colony.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		From what?  This woman?  You never gave
		her a chance.  How can you be so sure
		you're right?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		A better question is what makes you
		think I'm wrong?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You didn't see this thing -- this demon --
		Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		      (realizes)
		That's right.  You both did.
		      (beat)
		And what was it?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I -- I don't know what it was.  But I
		don't think Ripley was a party to it.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		She admits she brought it.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		But she tried to warn us --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You know that's how the devil works.
		Deception.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		But I believe her.  I don't know how to
		describe it -- A feeling.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
		Where does this feeling originate, John?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (points to his head)
		Here.

Pause.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I believe you.  But your feelings are
		fooling you.  

<b>			JOHN
</b>		It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Don't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		It's been a long night.  For all of us.
		You really don't understand what you're
		dealing with here.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		That's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		These are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under.  The creature is
		dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
		Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
		but leave this alone.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		But I --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
		into the Library, all right?  For your
		own good, just stay out of this.

John looks like he's going to protest.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I mean it.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (slowly)
		Yes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


<b>TWO ANCIENT WORKERS
</b>
Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.
Methodically covering up --

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Watching them work.
<b>BAM-BAM-BAM.
</b>Defeated.


<b>ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)
</b>
A dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco
escape ship - A frame of wood --
begin to wall it in...


<b>IN THE PRISON LEVEL
</b>
The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.
The planks cover more of the opening.
<b>BAM-BAM-BAM.
</b>
Covers more of Ripley.
<b>BAM-BAM-BAM.
</b>She stares...


<b>ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY
</b>
Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

<b>IN THE LIBRARY
</b>
John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Only her face is visible.
Another board.
<b>BAM-BAM-BAM.
</b>Then just her eyes.

Just before the last plank is put in place --

<b>			WORKER
</b>		Here you go, woman.  Something from your
		ship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
<b>BAM-BAM...BAM.
</b>
She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

<b>NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.
</b>
Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You fucking idiots!  You're dead!
		You're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		     (sotto)
		Dead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
		Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		     (snaps)
		Don't stare at me!

Beat.

<b>			VOICE O/S
</b>		Sorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

<b>A MAN'S FACE
</b>
Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


<b>ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT
</b>
The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


<b>INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN
</b>
John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

<b>PICTURES OF DEVILS
</b>
Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Now find John and have him brought to 
		me immediately.

<b>			THIRD BURLY MONK
</b>		Yes, Father.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


<b>INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY
</b>
The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


<b>KYLE
</b>
At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Hey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

<b>			KYLE
</b>		What?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		John - relax.  Take a deep breath -
		Christ, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (panting)
		Yes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

<b>			WHISPERING MONKS
</b>		He's got it...

<b>			SECOND WHISPERING MONK
</b>		Like the Comet Woman...

<b>			THIRD WHISPERING MONK
</b>		He found her...
<b>		
</b><b>			WHISPERING MONK
</b>		He's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
		see the --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Don't humor me -- I'm --
<b>	
</b><b>			KYLE
</b>		Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Wait -- JOHN!


<b>INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY
</b>
The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
<b>BITTEN THROUGH.
</b>
<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


<b>INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY
</b>
Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


<b>LADDERS
</b>
Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


<b>INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


<b>IN THE STALLS
</b>
Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Cold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>		Gets colder every night.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>		Right up your bloody backside.  Nights
		like this make me miss plumbing -- 
		Ack --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

<b>			ABBOT O/S
</b>		What?

<b>			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>		I don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


<b>OTHER MONKS
</b>
In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b><b>SPACE
</b>
Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

<b>			RIPLEY V.O.
</b>		Death...


<b>INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT
</b>
Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Wherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

<b>			WHITE-HAIRED MAN
</b>		Take it.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		You waiting for meat?  They don't bring
		me meat because they know I'm an android.
		Really don't need it.  Bread's better
		for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Not hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Waste of time.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		You don't eat, you'll starve to death,
		girl.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		That was the plan when they put me down
		here.  And why should you care?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Because I'm a synthetic person you don't
		think I can care?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Believe me, that's a discussion you don't
		want to have with me.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		You told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		That's one of each.  That means you could
		go either way.  I'm tired of talking about
		this.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
		the bastards --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
		dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
		get the satisfaction.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		He?  You make it sound like this Alien
		has a personal score to settle with you.
		The biology you describe:  Queen laying
		eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
		insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
		grudges.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		And Androids usually aren't the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe they're ancient 
		Greeks.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Medieval Monks.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Whatever.	

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		And they've only chose to live the life
		style, they don't believe they're --
		     (hears something)
		What's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (hoarse)
		Ripley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


<b>INT. ANTHONY'S CELL
</b>
Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV
</b>
John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
		You're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Brother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Made too good for that.  What're
		you doing?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		What?  You look like you've seen the
		devil.

<b>			RIPLEY O/S
</b>		He has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

<b>			ANTHONY 
</b>		You mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

<b>INT. THE CORRIDOR
</b>
As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
		you've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I can tell you have.  I was right.
		It came with me.
			(to the wall, sharp)
		Go away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I
		know what you want.  I can't help you.
		I couldn't help any of the others.  
		Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.
		Do you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You going to stay, Father?  But you're 
		not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
		listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
		was right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
		heresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
		That was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No, not the same one that's here now.
		Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
		same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
		I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
		When I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
		stayed alive to keep Newt alive.
		Hoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Now he got her too.  What's the point?
		     (hard again)
		Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
		let me out you'll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again.
		Let it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Puh. (pant) Please.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It never ends.


<b>INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

<b>			RIPLEY O/S
</b>		Sheep?

<b>RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY
</b>
Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		It must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in.
		Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race -- warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		And the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it, assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that
		to animals.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Wait a minute - I thought you were the
		expert on this monster.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Is that the only reason you came to get
		me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
		it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
		I was wrong not to say anything.  I was
		afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
		monk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We all are.  Took vows.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I don't know about the Abbot.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Is that speaking up for someone?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


<b>INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		All right, let's forget about the past
		and get on to our survival.  No more
		prisoners behind us?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Not for years.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this - What is this?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Arceon.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Satellite.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We can't.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		We can't what?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		A Tape Library?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Books.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		So?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The reason we are out here.  Like the
		Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
		on remote islands off England during
		the First Plague --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		There must be books on other colonies --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Some of these books survived the burning
		of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We're supposed to protect them.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (to Anthony)
		And what does an android have to do 
		with all this?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		He's a spy.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The Company planted me here.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		The Company?  What does the Company have
		to do with this?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		They built this prison.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Prison?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Colony.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Prison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You left that part out.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By
		this time the Corporate structure was
		transglobal, all the world's data storage
		systems were linked.  It spread through
		two countries before it was stopped.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		After a scare like that, thousands flocked
		to our retreat.  People started clamoring
		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I think I can see how this comes out.	
		They gave up their possessions.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		This was a threat --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		To the Company.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		They sold the technology.  A movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		Federal agents into a political movement
		against the Company-controlled World
		Government.  Too much was at stake.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Too much profit.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We were sentenced as political dissidents.
		This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
		were packed up with all our books, and
		towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
		eldest died very quickly.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		The Company had such a sense of irony.  
		Sending you out on this wooden tub.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I was placed among them as a sensor.
		Keeps tabs on the movement.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		So how'd they find out about you?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I told them.  After the supply ship's
		stopped coming I saw no point in keeping
		up the charade.  Since I was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology, they cast
		me down.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Join the club.
		     (to John)
		I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
		have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
		prudent to try to preserve man's written
		works for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		And I don't know about your New Plague,
		but I was just on Earth and everything's 
		fine.

John has a doubtful look.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
		Means I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (beat)
		Perhaps.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		That's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


<b>INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL
</b>
An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		At any rate, let's forget about the
		Earth completely - whether you're right
		or I'm right what's important is getting
		the hell out of here.  From here my ship
		is...?

John points up at the ceiling.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		In Heaven.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Right.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		This orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe --
			 (makes a circle in the air)
		They call the top half "Heaven - "

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The Abbey, the fields --

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The sea.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Really.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Work with me here.  How far is it back
		to the surface of the planet?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		As a stone falls --- Five miles through
		the center.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		And the elevator -- the thing they
		lowered me down in?

<b>			JOHN	
</b>		Ropes cut.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		It's smart.  First he cuts their escape
		off, then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Well, you start appreciating him more
		than me and I'll find a way to shut
		you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
		get up?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		There are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Five miles with the Alien between us
		and there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You can't --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Can't what?  Not help you go to your
		deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I need you.  I can't do it alone.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I've fought these creatures twice
		before.  It take a lot to kill
		these things.  Heavy artillery.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		We don't have weapons here.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		How about something we can make weapons
		from?  Do you have anything like that --
		any modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We renounced technology.  It was those
		things that caused the Plague.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		This is a man-made planet.  Something has
		to be recirculating your air, your water.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		God?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Please.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Most people do.  Without some sort of
		technology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		There is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
		and water come out.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		An atmosphere processing plant --

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The heart and lungs of Arceon.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Where is it?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		One level beneath the underground sea.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		That's five levels up --

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		     (points into the gloom)
		On the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		A chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		All right.  You've got me - so far.
		But here's the deal:  I don't know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there,
		but if we make it to my ship, you're
		all coming with me.  We'll take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry, but we're going.  I'm not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		We're all dead anyway.  We might as
		well go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Ugh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
		Come on.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


<b>AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

<b>THE CEILING
</b>
A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


<b>THE MONKS
</b>
Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


<b>THE MONKS IN THE FIELD
</b>
THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		     (sotto)
		Stay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Run!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		No - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


<b>			JOHN O/S
</b>		It isn't your fault, you know.


<b>INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Those things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I read about it in psychology books.
		Sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for, they transfer some of
		the guilt for that person's death to
		themselves.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I got a belly full of that from the
		Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
		"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
		like that.  But that's not what I was
		thinking about.  I was thinking about
		my "friend" up there.

She looks up.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
		not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
		he's playing with me.  Maybe they have
		some sort of race memory.  Maybe he
		knows what I did to his "mother."
		That's why he didn't just kill me.
		That would be too easy.  He has to
		torment me.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You make it sound human.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Hell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I think I do.


<b>INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


<b>INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


<b>AT THE LADDER
</b>
John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


<b>ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"
</b>
He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


<b>JOHN
</b>
Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
<b>CRACK -!
</b>WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

<b>WHACK!
</b>Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
<b>WHACK!
</b>Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
<b>WHACK!
</b>The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

<b>WHACK! 
</b>His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

<b>JOHN GRABS THEM!
</b>
Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Thanks.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Hold this against your nose.  It'll
		stop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		No - please.  Just let me sit.
		Awhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Damn it.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What was that?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Visions.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Dreams.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Androids can't dream...

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		That's probably what they thought when
		they built me.  But my brain is cyber-
		organic - patterned after the human
		brain - it functions the same way a
		human brain does.  It accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours, but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Androids don't sleep.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
		models, but I don't.  Do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
		the dreams while you're awake, as 
		hallucinations.  Same thing with me.
		For twenty years I absorbed data on this
		planetoid.  A little after we lost contact
		with Earth the visions started.  They
		thought I was insane.  I had to explain 
		that it was because I was an android.
		They liked that even less.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What did you see?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		What I always see.  Images of Monsters.
		Demons.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		They're portents.  They stand for an
		evil yet to come.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Just images I've absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I saw the inside of your cell.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		     (shrugs)
		My head is full of them.  I try to get
		them out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You need sleep.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Stay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Doctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Besides, you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I've faced this evil twice before - I
		guess I've gotten sensitive to it --
		     (beat)
		You're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		See my bag?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What's that book?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Just a book.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
		says we can't leave the planet without
		the library.
<b>			
</b><b>			JOHN
</b>		It's just... a medical book I might need.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You don't have any food in there, do you?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Only if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		In a few hours that's going to sound
		good.  Going in and out of suspended
		animation - Christ I probably haven't
		eaten in a year.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		    (without opening eyes)
		You should've eaten the bread.

<b>			RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>		Rest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You all right?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Aces.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You weren't hurt when I landed on you?
		Bruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Are you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Sort of.  My father passed on when we 
		first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
		Father Anselm - took me in.  He really
		raised me --
			  (pause)
		Taught me what he could before he
		passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Well, I'm just hungry.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You haven't eaten since I took you
		out of your tube.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Thank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

<b>			ANTHONY O/S
</b>		You should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


<b>A NARROW CORRIDOR
</b>
Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


<b>INT. LADDER SHAFT
</b>
A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


<b>A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR
</b>
Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Blood.
		     (sniffs)
		Mixed with sea water.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		We're getting close to the center of
		the arc -- near the sea.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Blood.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Getting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		The Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Father --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		   (sarcastic)
		What are you doing down here, father?
		You look like you've seen something
		that doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I was their spiritual leader.  I was not
		prepared to lead them in battle.
		Not against that thing.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No one could be.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I thought you said the evil was inside
		me -- that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought
		to us!

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I only tried to warn you.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		What are you doing with this woman --?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We are going to the Technology Room.
		Trying to find some way to fight --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You don't join the devil to fight the
		devil.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		She's helping us --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Look who defends the deceiver -- the one
		who isn't even human.  John, can't you see
		what is happening?  On ancient Earth,
		during the Black Death - many believed
		that God had abandoned them, so they
		appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies - losing their
		souls in the bargain.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Father, we're all on the run from the 
		same monster so let's not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine.  I've been
		enlightened about your "movement."
		Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Please. 

The time for pretense is past.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Sir --?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		I do what I have to do to keep the
		Brotherhood together.  We all gave up
		believing in Earth a long time ago.  How
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain?  That the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured?  Those men up there have
		grown to live with it.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		And with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		You threatened the status quo.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		So you, protector of knowledge and truth,
		lied to them.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Only about you.  The rest I still
		believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to Barbarism.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You're as bad as the Company.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Ripley --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		That's why you ran.  After all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Not afraid of death.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		The Alien.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The Organism.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		The Devil.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR
</b>
The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
<b>SNAPP!!!
</b>Everybody stops at the sound.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		What was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Man trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

<b>THE FLOOR
</b>
Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		In case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		What do we do?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't move.  Don't breath.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		We can't just stand here and wait.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Floor's too unstable to try to walk
		around them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
<b>SNAP!!
</b>
The others jump at the sound --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		John - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
		Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
		      (proud of him)
		Good work, Father John.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Brother.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Brother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>

<b>THE FOUR
</b>
Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


<b>THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM
</b>
A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


<b>BACK IN THE CORRIDOR
</b>
Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I just - are you allright?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
		hundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Hello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


<b>BEHIND THE PLANK
</b>
A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Technology.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		     (to Ripley)
		Go ahead.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Go ahead and what?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Open the door, woman.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'll get to it, but listen to me --
		you may dress like you're living in
		the middle ages but you can't treat
		me like your chambermaid, or whatever
		Monks had.


<b>UP THE HALL - ANTHONY
</b>
Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


<b>ANTHONY POV
</b>
The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

<b>			ABBOT
</b><b>		OPEN IT!!
</b>
Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


<b>HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN
</b>
<b>SNAP!!
</b>His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
<b>AT THE END OF THE HALL
</b>
Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


<b>FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN
</b>
Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


<b>JOHN
</b>
Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		What's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Shit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


<b>JOHN
</b>
WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


<b>THE DOOR KEYBOARD
</b>
Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


<b>JOHN
</b>
His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


<b>THE DOOR
</b>
Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It's open!!


<b>JOHN
</b>
PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		We wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Hurry --

<b>			JOHN
</b><b>		HURRY!!
</b>

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
<b>ANGRY.
</b>

<b>THE KEYBOARD
</b>
Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
<b>INCHES...
</b>
The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


<b>WINDMILLS
</b>
Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

<b>							DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)
</b>
Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


<b>IN THE TUBE
</b>
Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
		fucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY
</b>
Ripley opens her eyes.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I thought we'd lost you.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What are you writing?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Last will and testament.
		      (beat)
		Just kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Is he --?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Resting.
		      (shakes his head)
		He'll be fine.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'm sorry.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		It's ironic.  I guess my visions were
		prescience after all.  How will I ever
		resolve that with my artifical con-
		science?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Do you see what you've delivered us
		into?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
		kick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Oh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Where is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		On the other side of that door.
		Waiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It's playing with us.  It could get in
		here any time it wants.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Why should he enter?  He knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
		to speak.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Maybe more than one of us.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		This is your technology?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Even this is forbidden to us.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
		generated down here --
		     (looks at the floor)
		Windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground, create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water...

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		More than that.  There are pumps beneath
		the floor - I can feel their vibration.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters.

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Yes...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
		cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
		planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't you see?  This is a planet set to
		self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
		finite.  If the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
		will be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		It's here.  I was just hoping I would be
		dead long before it came to this.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		The punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		This planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.
		The Company's best work.  You know, I used
		to be a corporate executive.  Middle range
		V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
		I chucked it all and joined the order.
		Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
		being chairman of the board...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No, now I understand why I landed here.
		To join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Ripley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

<b>			ABBOT
</b>		Where can she go?  She's trapped.
		       (beat)
		Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison
		in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
		Sparklets of light - dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof...

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

<b>SPLORTCH-KT--!!
</b>The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


<b>A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER
</b>
Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
<b>WHACK-K -!!
</b>BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
		head!

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I didn't have to see that to know what
		that means.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
		I can't get away from him.  He's fucking
		with my mind.  He's my punishment!

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I'm confused.  Before you said it came out
		of the torso, not the head --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Ripley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I should just wait for the air to run out...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I believe - I know - that we can win --
		there is an answer in our books.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
		Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
		they aren't already - are dead.

<b>			JOHN	
</b>		If that's true, then all of us, the books,
		are consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

<b>			ANTHONY O/S
</b>		Ripley?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What?

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		There are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other Aliens you described.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Give it up.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I think this is important.  This may help
		us fight it.  The creature that I fought
		in the hall - when I first saw it, it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
<b>			
</b><b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before -- black, mechanical --
		unless that was a dream.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		I don't think it was.  I think that this 
		creature, if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is, has the ability to
		adapt to its environment.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Then the reason they've always looked the
		same to me is that I only ever saw them in
		the same environment.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development -- you saw a queen -- This
		could be like a King ant -- more highly
		advanced than the drone, bred for 
		survival -?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		How does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs.  The chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats - The first
		one I ever saw came out of Kane after he
		started to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No what?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No, we're not beat yet, Father --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Brother --

Ripley gets up.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
		then maybe we can use that.  We can beat
		this bastard.  We can get to my ship.
		We can live.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM
</b>
John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		He could be waiting on the other side
		of that door.  We might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


<b>AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT
</b>
The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Must be day on the surface of the planet.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Where is the light coming from?
<b>	
</b><b>			JOHN
</b>		Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
		great shafts -- through lenses.  That's
		what they make in the glass factory. 
		Lenses.  Look --

She turns:

<b>A HUGE WATERFALL
</b>
Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one
		at either end.  I came down on the other
		side.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We cross.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		John?  Ripley?

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>He knows it is not.

<b>			ANTHONY
</b>		Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


<b>THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT
</b>
The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Your hands okay?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		They'll be fine.  You've been on
		a boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I was a warrant officer on a ship --
		but I did all my sailing in space.

<b>			JOHN		
</b>		Father Anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		How old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here?	

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Five.  The Abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here.  We've had almost forty
		more.  Until now.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What happened to your mother?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.
		I mean, I did, once.  She left my father
		when he joined the movement.  If she
		hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
		the other children with the women, on
		Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
		a dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Did you know that I was a mother?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The girl in the ship with -?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
		daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
		I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
		Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
		the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
		you know it I said.  My shares would have
		set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
		to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
		70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
		girl who's mother never came home.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Jesus Christ.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		They said I should have been happy to be
		alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
		back the second time.  Not so I could
		fight it -- You can't fight it -- So
		I could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You didn't choose to get lost in space.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Thanks for the try Father --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Brother.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
		I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
		I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
		I can be a good mother to you.  I can make
		sure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Blood.

John looks up.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		From the levels above.

His face goes white.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		He must have slaughtered all --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't think about it.  Don't think about
		what's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


<b>A SHAPE
</b>
Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


<b>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT
</b>
Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


<b>UP THE LADDER
</b>
A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


<b>INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley and John come up from the level below.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Stop.  How far?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


<b>THE MONASTERY LEVEL
</b>
Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


<b>THE MONASTERY
</b>
Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


<b>INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		This is the glassworks.  They have
		tools here --
			(spots)
		Kyle --

He runs across the room --


<b>BROTHER KYLE
</b>
Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		     (sotto)
		Can't see my baby.
		Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
		Black king on red queen, put the
		ace up --

John SHAKES him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Kyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		John - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

<b>			KYLE
</b>		Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
		Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
		boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
		looma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Keep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
		killed him.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You had to.  You're supposed to end
		suffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Let's get the hell out of here.


<b>INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


<b>INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		He's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
		did this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

<b>AAAROO --!
</b>A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Mattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

<b>			JOHN		
</b>		He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
		dog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames.  Just
		grab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Easy, boy...

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Is there another way out?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Not that will do us any good.


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
		Where is my ship from here?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		On the roof directly above this room.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Here's the plan --
<b>		
</b><b>			JOHN
</b>		But the books --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Forget the books!

<b>RUFF!!
</b>Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Shit.


<b>MATTIAS
</b>
Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

<b>SPLIIIITCH -!
</b>Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		No!  THE BOOKS!!

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


<b>THE FLOOR COLLAPSES
</b>
The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


<b>INTO THE GLASSWORKS
</b>
The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Are you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
<b>HSSS!
</b>POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Ripley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
		out of --

<b>SUDDENLY
</b>
THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


<b>JOHN
</b>
Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Ripley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


<b>THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER
</b>
DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Saw that happen to a bottle once.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (panting)
		Beat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		We've got to get to the Library --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
<b>BARKS...
</b>

<b>INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Don't be stupid --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Some of them!  I've got to save some of
		them!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		They're lost.  You did your best.  If
		you get out, it wasn't in vain.
		We've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

<b>			RIPLEY O/S
</b>		Come on in!

John and Mattias step through --


<b>INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		The Library --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Not working.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What does that mean?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It means I don't know how long I was
		in hyper sleep.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		It means the Abbot could've been right --
<b>		
</b><b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It means my clock isn't working.  We have
		to get out of here.  Even if he was right
		this ship's onboard computer is filled 
		with man's knowledge.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Not everything.  Some things will be
		lost forever. 

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Then man starts over.  He's done it
		before.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Okay.  The seals weren't broken so
		we're probably clear.  But those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon.  Let's get ready to
		take off.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What can I do?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Here, I need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Hey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Hey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I know.  I locked you in.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		What?

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I'm not going with you.  I've got one
		inside me.
<b>	
</b><b>			JOHN
</b>		What?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I figured it out.  That's why it didn't
		kill me.  He must have impregnated me
		when I was in the stasis tube.
		    (remembers nightmare)
		It hasn't come out yet because I 
		haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
		either I eat and it kills me or I don't
		eat and I starve to death.  Either way 
		I die.

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

<b>			JOHN	
</b>		My book -- I know what to do --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What, an exorcism?  No good.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You can't do this.  Ripley - listen
		to me - you're confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		    (ignoring)
		I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes
		the Colony's gravitational pull this
		compartment will open.  Then all you have 
		to do is get into the Stasis tube with
		Mattias and press the blue button.  With
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up.  Good luck.

He pounds his fists against the door.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
		You can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		It always wins.  We killed it, but it's
		still inside me -- You're my last chance.
		If I can keep you alive it'll make up
		for all those I've lost.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Listen to me!  You have to let me try!
		Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

She's listening...

<b>			JOHN
</b>		I told you Father Anselm raised me.
		He raised me and when he was dying I
		couldn't do anything to save him.  I 
		didn't know enough.  It was my fault
		he died.  If you don't let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead.

Ripley turns and stares at him.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Please.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>THE PAGE
</b>
<b>A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
</b>A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		What is this stuff?

<b>			JOHN
</b>		     (forceful)
		Something that will make you well.
		Something that will make you sick.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		I don't --

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Shut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
<b>WHAMM -!!
</b>
Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

<b>WHAM!  WHAM --!
</b>John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
<b>HEAVES --
</b>
Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


<b>THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER
</b>
SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

<b>INTO JOHN'S!!
</b>Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		Why?
<b>	
</b><b>			JOHN
</b>		Choking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		They knew.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		But you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		You'll die --

John stumbles to the Pod door.  Turns back.

<b>			JOHN	
</b>		That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If
		we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --
		either way, where we belong.  World of
		books.  Pages.

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		You... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

<b>			JOHN
</b>		Stay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

<b>			RIPLEY
</b>		No - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


<b>BROTHER JOHN
</b>
Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
<b>INCINERATED.
</b>
The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --


<b>SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4
</b>
Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.
ROARS towards us - past us.


<b>INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 = DAY
</b>
Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


<b>JOHN'S PARCHMENT
</b>
Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

<b>			JOHN V.O.
</b>		I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter
		Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know
		the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great
		evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to
		paper now lest this plague - this creature
		stills my hand.  I have gone down below -
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman - Ripley - get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil, or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her.  She believes there is
		still and Earth and I hope she is right.
		I hope she will be able to find out.
		I hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

<b>			RIPLEY V.O.
</b>		Whether the Earth exists or not, whether
		we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold
		vacuum of space, she has.

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.

<b>                              SYNOPSIS
</b>
     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an <u>alien language</u>,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

</b><b>EXT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A
</b><b>BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.
</b>His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that
permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads
"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and
the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling
around.
<b>INT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.
</b>
The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old
and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would
be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.

<b>ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT
</b>
Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is
trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He
drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside
him.

<b>                     YOUNG ADULT
</b>
           Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...

Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he
walks past the student.
<b>                     KWAN
</b>           At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks
           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
                   (beat)

           ... then we trained some more.
He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.
<b>                     YOUNG ADULT
</b>                   (getting back into horse stance)
           I guess not...
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON KWAN
</b>As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is
moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and
rearranges her hands.
<b>                       KWAN
</b>              Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward
the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.
It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As
he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
<b>                       STUDENT
</b>              Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce
              Lee...

<b>                       KWAN
</b>
              Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in
              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is
              effective. Show me.

The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half
looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.
The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching
Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.

<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
                    (shaking his head)

              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never
              mind.

He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.
Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the
master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't
know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is
doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.
RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously
hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and
underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,
while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They
are all very impressed.

<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>              Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen
              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.
              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!
This last he says looking at the empty door.
<b>                       MOTHER
</b>
              I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.
<b>
</b><b>                    KWAN
</b>           Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors
           depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the
           T'ang emporer.
He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering
his students around him.
<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.
                  (to class)
During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the
martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,
there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed
like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

He turns to go.

One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.

<b>                    STUDENT 2
</b>
           What do you want us to do?

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the
           cliff. Understand?

<b>                    STUDENT 2
</b>
           No.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           No matter.
He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.

They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.
<b>EXT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.
</b>
It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is
candlelight inside, and it is moving around ­ an effect not unlike a
ghost carrying a candelabra.

<b>INT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.
</b>The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu
and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the
spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW
<b>
</b>CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare
shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu
maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot
wax on his    skin (INSERT).
In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.
<b>ANGLE ON KWAN
</b>Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching
Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body
moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.
Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts
instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls
but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and
Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost
move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping
Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is
lit by the TV screen.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
<b>              MASTER KWAN!
</b>
He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.
It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's
chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to
wipe the hot wax off.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!

<b>                       KWAN
</b>                    (blustering)

              I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?
<b>DREW
</b>Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling
the already hard wax off his chest.

<b>                       DREW
</b>              Practicing. I saw it in this movie...
Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of
him.
<b>                       KWAN
</b><b>
</b>           Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...
           Should study tapes of opponent.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had
           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?
<b>                      KWAN
</b>           Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we
           had tapes, we would have watched them.
Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.
<b>                      KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           "The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win
           100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.
           All    these years of one on one training ­ you're the best
           I've    ever taught.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           The best?

<b>                      KWAN
</b>
           Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior
           ­ the rest will take care of itself.

                   (picks up tape)

           Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!

Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his
hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when
Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he
is very angry.

<b>                      BOB
</b>
                   (shouting)
           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?

<b>                      DREW
</b>           Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?
<b>                      BOB
</b>
           It's your attitude that bothers me, son.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension
in the room, and starts to say something.
<b>                      BOB
</b><b>
</b>                 (cutting him off)
           Don't say a word, yellow man.
<b>REACTION SHOT OF KWAN
</b>Closing his already opened mouth.
<b>                    BOB (CONT'D)
</b>           You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were
           taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and
           make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!
<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (sarcastic)
           When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going
           to let you be part of my entourage...

<b>                    BOB
</b>
           You mean when you're in jail...

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything
           from you.

He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the
workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.

Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.

He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.

<b>                    BOB
</b>
           How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you
           never really wanted... ?
<b>                    KWAN
</b>           I wish I had the chance...

Kwan exits, and we...
<b>EXT. TREVOR ESTATE ­ DAY

The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully
laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR
and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite
applause is
<b>COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED.
</b><b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>As he knocks out an opponent.
<b>ANGLE ON CROWD
</b>Applauding.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique
and puts the guy down and out.
<b>ANGLE ON TEAM
</b>(Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>As he plays with the next fighter.

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>
              They said you were good... ha!

He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no
denying that he's a superior fighter.

<b>                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
              Can't you get me any quality sparring partners?

The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,
DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.

<b>                         PFEELGUT
</b>
              It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy
              your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat
              him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear
              you    forever.

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to
leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.
Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.
<b>                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
</b>              Exactly!
Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy,
alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to
hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to
fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to
back up, laughing with the rest of the group.

<b>ANGLE ON PFEELGUT
</b>Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.
<b>                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b><b>           GET HIM! NOW!!
</b>Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees
what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and
(in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull
his pants up.
<b>ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY
</b>Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.
<b>INT. TREVOR HOUSE ­ SAME DAY

</b>The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure
and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going
over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master,
MASTER KIM, comes into the room.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           Ah, Master Kim.

                 (to physiologist)

           I'll look at these stats later.

Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is
sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

</b>Winning. The stage is set for the finals.
<b>ANGLE ON THE RING
</b>Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish
mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is
decked out in designer, personalized gear.

              Fighting for the Grand Championship: Trevor Gottitall and
              Drew Carson. 3 rounds, max point. Gentlemen, bow to the
              ref, to each other...

The referee gives them a signal and the fight begins. Drew is holding
his own, but Trevor is scoring. After several flashy moves, the round
is over.

Score: 6 - 1. We see Trevor's cheerleaders cheering.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER

Where he is given mineral water to drink, his shoulders are massaged,
etc.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER

Kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup.

2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing
he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor
of Trevor.
<b>ROUNDBREAK
</b>
Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready
to go on forever.
<b>                      KWAN

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER
</b>The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back
on his padded stool, smiling.
The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,
making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and
(INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring
<b>
</b>around Drew's waist and pulls.
They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As
Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score,
just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming.
Drew's pants drop lower and lower.
When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches
down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw,
effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world.
CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and
recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc.
Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.
A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round.
Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to
crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.

sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the
pain of Drew's bruises.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...
He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew
looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the
           time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
           coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers
           stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.
           It was all we had left to eat ­ no more money. These were
           hard times in China, people were selling their children
           for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop
           soldiers with guns, though? Yes?

He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it
and turning it slightly this way and that.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of
           the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.
           Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and
           the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,
           and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,
           and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing
           with the dust of the street.

Kwan smiles with the memory ­ it is a sweet and heroic one.
<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,
           touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I
           watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was
           larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed
           then and there to become like him, fight for right like
           the Shaolin.
He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why
he is telling him this story.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           I never did, though. My family left China and ended up
           here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in
<b>
</b>           China.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           You mean... all the stories...?
<b>                     KWAN
</b>                   (nodding)
           Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I
           realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself
           that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other
           people.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Why are you telling me this?
<b>                     KWAN
</b>
           I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was
           never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have
           all the potential in the world, but I can't take you
           where you want to go.

Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where
it was with a cotton ball.

<b>                     KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           There, that should control the swelling.

He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           So you're not a Shaolin?

<b>                     KWAN
</b>
           No.

<b>                     DREW
</b>           Never were?

<b>                     KWAN
</b>           No.
Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his
face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.

<b>                     KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           What?
<b>                     DREW
</b>
           If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.
<b>                     KWAN

<b>                       DREW
</b>           I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I
           will never lose like that again.
Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's
eyes.
<b>                       KWAN
</b>           He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
           cloth.
He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.
<b>                       DREW
</b>                 (eyes intent)

           Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right
           training ­    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's
           holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you
           couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.

Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving
the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.

<b>                       KWAN
</b>
           I must pay for your ticket...

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           No! I'll make it there myself.

<b>                       KWAN
</b>
           I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be
           those stories. You can live my dream for me ­ at least
           let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble
           he's caused.
Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew
nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner.

willow trees there.

Drew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through
flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables.
People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man

at martial arts movements.

They wave at each other, and Ashema pushes her bike off.

Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it
all sink in.

After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front
door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.
<b>INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.
</b>
The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of
the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half
light takes over.
He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of
temple shots, establishing the feeling of the
<b>
</b>temple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the
floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the
temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the
ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of
Bodhidharma, etc.
No one is around.
Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders
into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.
Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense
burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in
rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes
are open, but they don't seem to see him.
He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.
He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".

<b>HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.

All manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men,
posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams,
etc.).

A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of
a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.

The post TREMBLES with every strike.

Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk
takes no notice of him.

<b>                       DREW

              Excuse me, Master.
No answer.

              Hello? Busy, huh?
Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,
over and over.
Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes
are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the
distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the
path.
Drew walks up to the monk and bows.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b>           Master, may I ask you a question?

           Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?
           Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?
He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.
He walks back into the chanting chamber.
<b>INT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,
moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.
Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           That was great! Great!

The monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.

           No tourists! Temple closed!

<b>                    DREW

Several monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit.

           I'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk!
The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk,
and they have a short conversation in Chinese.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
             I'm not leaving.

Drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is
going to hold his breath until he turns blue.

<b>                     MONK
</b>
             You give me no choice.

                  (to other monks)

             Remove him.

He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew
and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the
door.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
             I just want to be a monk!

Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.

They pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He
watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through
it, out of the temple.
He smiles.

A group of people stop and watch the foreigner. The temple door
closes with a solid boom.

<b>                     DREW
</b>             Hey! What about my...
<b>
</b>The temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack.
It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear,
and some socks.
The people standing around laugh.
Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He
sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops
and stands ringing the courtyard.
He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running
them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man
is sitting down sipping his tea.
The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on,
when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall.
<b>                    ASHEMA
</b>
           Drew?

<b>                    DREW

Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him.

Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising
from it.

Drew's shoulders slump even more.

The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in
Chinese, motioning towards Drew.

           My nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about
           the temple.

The grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really
don't want to listen.

<b>                      ASHEMA (CONT'D)
</b>
           He is telling a story about a monk who was refused
           admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be
           allowed to be a monk.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           What did he do?

Ashema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese.

<b>                      ASHEMA
</b>
           He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until
           they let him in.

<b>                      DREW
</b>           How long?
<b>                      ASHEMA
</b>           A long time ­ through the worst weather. He just sat
           there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.
<b>                      DREW

           Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my
<b>
</b>           Bau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple
           until they could no longer say no. He went on to become
           one of the most famous monks in the history of the
           temple.
Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up
and smiles.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise

The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.

Drew shakes his head.

He starts away from the stand.

He walks off into the Chinese night.

The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are
illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged
in front of the door.

It is Drew, backpack at his side.
The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around,
and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he
quickly disappears inside.
Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is
standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there.
<b>                     ADMISSIONS MONK
</b>
           Go home! You cannot stay here!
No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead.

</b>
           Do you hear me? Go away!
Drew doesn't move.
San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind
<b>
</b>him carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting
there. He walks on.
The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry.

down across from him.

</b>
           Has it been hard?
<b>                    DREW
</b>           It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually,

           mean?
<b>                    SAN DE

           Much of the training at the temple is in that direction ­

</b>           At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,

</b>           things changed. Maybe it's like hitting the wall in
           running ­ it was like I became part of the courtyard, and
           I felt powerful. Even the spider became my friend...
Drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           It was an incredible experience ­ I said I'd do it, and I

San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and
bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.

O.S. comes the sounds of gongs and drums.

A crowd has gathered in the courtyard. Ashema and her grandfather are
in the crowd, and they work themselves up to where Drew is.

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some
older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all
in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

The young men who are walking in all still have hair, and they are
carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.

</b>           They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting
           monks at Shaolin.
Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the
temple doors.
The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go
through.
The temple doors close.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who is crushed. His chance is gone.

</b>           I'm sorry, Drew. It was a good effort.
Drew is sitting there, trying to understand what is happening when
the door to the temple opens again. The Drill Sergeant appears in the
doorway and impatiently motions for Drew to come in.
The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold.
Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick.
The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up.
Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his
backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so
long.
The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.
Drew runs into the temple. The door closes behind him.

<b>INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR OF TEMPLE.
</b>
The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack
in hand, takes his place at the end of the line.

They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside
the temple.

As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are
put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple
are openly hostile to him.

They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each
holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.

A gong sounds, and the questions begin.

<b>ANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE
</b>Who is asked...

<b>                    MONK
</b>           Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?
<b>                    DISCIPLE 1
</b>
           Yes, without pause.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b><b>                    MONK
</b>           Do you renounce the earthly world?
<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Sure do, master. You bet.
<b>
</b>The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question.
The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the
monk then continues.
<b>                     MONK
</b>           Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it
           means death?
<b>                     DREW
</b>           I do.
The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side
with his elbow.
<b>                     DRILL SERGEANT
</b>                   (whispering)

           Answer "Yes, without pause."

<b>                     DREW
</b>
                   (rubbing his side)

           Yes, without pause.

<b>ANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE
</b>
<b>                     MONK
</b>
           Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple?

<b>                     DISCIPLE 2
</b>
           Bodhidharma.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
<b>                     MONK
</b>
           Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your
           spiritual leaders?
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Yes, without pause.
The Drill Sergeant nods his head.
<b>                     MONK
</b>
           Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal
           gain?

Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him
on.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Yes, without pause.
<b>
</b>The D.S. puts his hands over his eyes.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I mean, no, of course not.
Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded.
A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows
down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards
the raised platform in the center.
Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure.
It is San De!
San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then
clears his throat.
Everyone stands up again.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin
           Temple?

<b>                      DRILL SERGEANT
</b>
           Yes, without pause, Master San De.

</b>
                 (under his breath)

           I'll be damned!

The DISCIPLE next to him, GAO, pokes him sharply in the ribs.

<b>                      GAO
</b>           Shut up!

<b>                      DREW
</b>                 (holding his side)
           Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>           Are they ready to begin their training?
<b>                      DRILL SERGEANT
</b>           They are.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Then, let us welcome them into our ranks!
<b>
</b>Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised
on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside.
<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
</b>All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring
at Drew.
Drew, notices the stare.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           You got a problem, man?
<b>                    GAO
</b>           You, American...
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
When the noise subsides.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will
           introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.

San De walks away, and the disciples are split into several
"platoons". Drew is matched up with the Drill Sergeant, and Gao is
also in his group.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Great, just great.

They are motioned to follow Gao out of the courtyard and into the
temple proper.

<b>INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>
Drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their
robes. As he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take Drew's
backpack. Drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.

<b>                    DREW
</b>           What are you doing, man?
<b>                    MONK
</b>
           You must surrender this.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           No way, man! Get your own...

The Drill Sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the backpack into
           the sleeping quarters.
<b>
</b>                 (to Drew)
           Do not cling to material things ­ it is not good for your
           soul.
He walks away, and Drew reluctantly gives up his backpack.
Drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when Gao slides
over and takes them from him. Drew immediately shoves him and tries
to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes
up and away from Drew.
Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI,
another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives
it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is

As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks
throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is more excited than all the others.

<b>ANGLE ON THE D.S.

building.

           A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask
           questions. He just obeys.

The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples
follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not
believing what they are doing.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

sweated through and dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm
muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the
pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back
straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.
As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He
drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as
<b>
</b>he can, but there is no one to be seen.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES
</b>As they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an
American song as they work.

The monks are singing along with him. All except for Gao.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH
</b>
It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece
of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The

D.S. is standing over his shoulder.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           Any problems?

Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up
onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the
D.S. is there in front of him.

He examines the baskets. They are not full.
He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.

<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (shocked)

<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Do a job well or don't do it.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,
then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When
Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.
<b>
</b><b>                       D.S.
</b>           Sorry, all gone. Get some more.
Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up
at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of
water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The
D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to
work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to
himself.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah...
Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.
<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM.

Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders
are straining from the weight of the buckets.

He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over
chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at
the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for
him.

Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a
little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.
motions for him to put the buckets down.

Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall
over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop
them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the
ground.

<b>                       DREW

<b>                       DREW
</b>           No chance, Gao. You back up.
Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew
in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and
fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt
in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and
continues walking.
<b>CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND
</b>A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.
walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.

<b>                       D.S.

                 (heartlessly)

           Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you
           will be fine.

He walks away.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>
On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the
distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.

In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.
They are leading him out.

The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the
disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The
two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.

then closes on Gao a little bit.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           There's something on the bottom of your basket.

Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,
he JAMS the stick in, and holds it there.

           Oops! I think I found the problem.

Drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down
onto Gao's head. They back away as Gao goes running towards the pit
where the night soil is deposited.

The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to
explode, and Drew has the match.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           I'm for going to the Headmaster right now!
They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move.
Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

           You're either with us, Gao, or you're against us.

No answer from Gao. They exit the room.

<b>INT. SHAOLIN HALLWAY ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS.
</b>
Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing
there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for
instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them.

<b>                    DREW
</b>           Master San De!

<b>                    DREW
</b>           No, really, I want to...
San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical
           labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility
           and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be
           given chores every    day ­ remember the first time you saw
           me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble.

</b>
Who tonight have been anything but humble.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           You've all performed    admirably, and have learned an
           important lesson ­ to    obey your shr fu without question.
           Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial
           training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow
           morning.

The disciples can hardly believe their luck.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           And, what did you have to say to me?

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is sputtering now.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           I... I mean we, just wanted to... thank you for the
           opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the
           Shaolin Temple.

                 (beat)
           Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?
They all say "Thank you" as one, and then bow to the headmaster with
their hands clasped in front of them. They turn away and head down
the hallway.
<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
</b>
As they increase their pace, almost running through the halls with
their excitement.

<b>INT. DORM AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DOOR TO THE SLEEPING QUARTERS.
</b>Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They
fan out into the room, Drew in the center.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Gentlemen, this calls for a party!
He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and
puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.
Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most
accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.
The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.
Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff ­
the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Glowering, as he moves toward the boom box.

He reaches for the "Stop" button.

Drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           You're trying to get us all kicked out!

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!

They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks
and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.

The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set
to do battle.

Just then, the door starts to open. Everyone freezes and looks toward
the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to
jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.
<b>ANGLE ON DOOR
</b>As the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.
He surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with Drew
lying on his bed.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who waves to the D.S.

<b>ANGLE ON THE D.S.
</b>Who knows that something is going on.
<b>                    D.S.
</b><b>
</b>           Go to sleep. Lights out.
He hits the lights and then closes the door. In the semi-darkness the
room relaxes in a collective sigh. Drew stands up and packs up the
stereo.
Gao walks over past Drew.
<b>                    GAO
</b>           It's not over, American.
<b>INT. MAIN CHAMBER ­ MORNING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING
</b><b>THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS.
</b>Kick. Punch.
Kick. Punch.

INTERCUT of feet striking the stone floor, depressions in the floor
testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen.

Through the door come the D.S., Drew and the others. They line up
along one wall, watching the fighting monks go through their form.

It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.

Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with
his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to
line up as the monks had.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,
           alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is
           free time.

D.S. lets that sink in, then motions for the monk to take over.

<b>                    MONK
</b>           In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a
           series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the
           times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu
           from these exercises.
He goes through a couple of martial movements.
<b>                    MONK (CONT'D)
</b>
           The spirit of Bodhidharma remains. Training is like
           meditation. Be aware of everything, but aware of nothing
           in particular. Think not thinking.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?
<b>                    MONK
</b><b>
</b>            Non thinking.

</b>            Your training begins today, in this most sacred of

            fighting monks from centuries past.
<b>ANGLE ON FLOOR
</b>Where there are depressions and worn spots, the result of thousands
of hours of training.

<b>                    MONK (CONT'D)

            At the Shaolin temple, we forge our bodies in the fire of
            our wills. We adhere to a vow of non-violence, unless
            someone else is in danger... Follow my movements...

He starts moving through a series of techniques, and the rest of the
disciples try to mimic his actions. He is moving around the room, and
they are trying to do what he is doing.

Some are getting it, some aren't.

Drew, used to a more individualized type of training, isn't getting
it.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF WEDGE THWOCKING INTO THE GROUND.
</b>
A hand COMES INTO FRAME, grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the
ground.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Drew, along with the other disciples, lined up
and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back
out. Their muscles are bulging with the effort.
<b>ANGLE ON HUGE SMOKING BRASS URNS
</b>Filled to the brim with small stones. Drew is forcing his arms into
the urn in "Iron Palm" training.

<b>ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES
</b>He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never
missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet
off the ground.
<b>ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES
</b>He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls,
almost impaling himself on a pole.
<b>                      DREW

<b>                      D.S.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF.
</b>Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series
of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to
blocked by a special Shaolin technique.

Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD.

His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him.

<b>                      MONK
</b>
           Block the way I showed you.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
                 (showing him a block)

           This is the way I was taught.

<b>                      MONK (CONT'D)
</b>
           Do it this way. You won't get hit.

Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time,
however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew.

Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily
deflect Drew's kick.
<b>                      GAO
</b>                 (menacingly)
           My turn.
He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way
he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao.
Gao stands over him, smiling.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING
</b><b>KICKS, AERIALS, ETC.
</b>A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and
<b>
</b>kipping up.
Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of
which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no
trouble.
Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is
very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist.
<b>                      MONK
</b>              Emotions cloud the spirit ­ eliminate them.
<b>                      DREW

<b>                      MONK
</b>              This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.

Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the
air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.
</b>
The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete
floor. D.S. stands in the middle.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
              I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the
              day. I'll need a partner...

He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully,
walks to the front and bows to D.S.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
              Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from
              shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling.

<b>                      DREW
</b>                   (looking at ground)
              Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.
<b>                      D.S.
</b>              Do they always use mats in America?

The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now
challenged.

<b>                      D.S. (CONT'D)
</b>              If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao
              would assist me...
<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b><b>
</b>Who is already getting up, ready and willing.
This changes Drew's mind right away.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S.
</b><b>                     DREW
</b>           Let's do it.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Attack me straight on...
Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard
concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow.
Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the
ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.

<b>ANGLE ON THE GROUP
</b>
Who can barely watch the destruction.

<b>ANGLE ON THE FIGHT
</b>
The D.S. does not let up at all, taking

Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew
gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood
coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more.

Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of
all of them, the D.S. calls it a day.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>
           Any questions? Good, that's all for today.

Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he
can, obviously in pain.

<b>                     DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.

The group gasps, knowing how much Drew must be hurting, admiring him
for his guts. Even Gao is impressed.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>           I said that's enough.
<b>                     DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I
           understand.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Attack!

Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing
<b>
</b>Drew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the
last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He
moans and groans and lies there.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!
The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to
Drew, who is still lying on the ground.
<b>                       LI
</b>           Are you trying to kill yourself?
<b>                       DREW
</b>           He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's
           all.

He tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down.

Li helps him up and takes him to the showers.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S.
</b>
Watching them go. There is a slight smile on his face.

<b>EXT. DORMITORY ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LI RUBBING THE BRUISE ON DREW'S SHOULDER WITH
</b><b>TIGER BALM.
</b>
It is huge, and looks really painful.

<b>                       LI
</b>
           If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor...

Drew pulls away and stands up. He backs up to the wall of the
dormitory, right underneath a window.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious.
           I'm all right.

Just as he is talking, Gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty
water (from washing the floor of the dorm).

<b>GAO LOOKS DOWN (GAO POV) AND SEES DREW
</b>Hhe smiles, then pours the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As the dirty water hits him, drenching him.
<b>EXT. WATERFALL ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.
</b>It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON A MONK, INSIDE THE WATERFALL
</b>He is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders
onto him.
<b>ANGLE ON D.S. AND GROUP
</b>As they stand on the bank.
<b>                        D.S.
</b>              Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try
              to hold your stance. Li, you're first.
Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes
behind the thundering water.
He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance.
He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S.
</b>
Who motions him farther into the water.

<b>ANGLE ON LI
</b>
Who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. As soon as he
gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he
falls about 20 feet into the pool below.

<b>                        D.S.
</b>
              Next...

Each of them try it in turn. Everyone fails.

Gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water
for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
It's his turn. He walks to the waterfall and goes in. He picks up an
umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "NEW YORK
GIANTS NFL" logo on it ­ unmistakably American).

He walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment.
Drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse
stance.
He turns to smile at the D.S., and then waves at the others. As soon
as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams
him and off he goes into the pool.
He lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. Drew comes
to the surface, still clutching the now- destroyed umbrella. He
smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.
<b>                        DREW
</b>
              Thought I'd join you guys.
<b>INT. TEMPLE TRAINING HALL ­ DAY
</b><b>
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUPS WORKING OUT.
</b>Drew is in with the group. Gao and Drew are chosen to do a training
exercise together.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest
           lightly, and your partner tries to block.
The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving
Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew
doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls
back to the ground.
The D.S. is there immediately.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Something wrong?

Drew shakes his head and gets back up.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>
           Switch!

Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same
amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him
off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.

Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over.

<b>                     MONK
</b>
           The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just
           try to tap his chest.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I know, but...

<b>                     MONK
</b>           Then do it that way...
The Monk walks away, shaking his head.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI
</b><b>PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE.
</b>Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying
watching him.
To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.

<b>                     DREW
</b>           This sure beats sweeping...
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON FRISBEE
</b>Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely
missing them.
Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder
than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it
dead center, right in the face.
The statue starts to tip!
Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips
over and smashes on the ground.
They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't
fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.
coming towards them.
Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.

He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.
rounds the corner.

The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.

<b>                       D.S.
</b>
           Sweep the main chamber, Drew.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Yes, master.

He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training
chamber.

<b>INT. CHAMBER ­ SAME EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER.
</b>
This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just
stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it.

He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and
stands staring at it.

QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who begins to sweep.

His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and
soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as
a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,
his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.
He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a
corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a
microphone.

              Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the
              Shaolin temple... Drew Carson!
Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary
crowd.
<b>                          DREW
</b>              The crowd is going wild.
Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into
Drew's unprotected stomach!
Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee,
and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach.
Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and
sends him pitching to the floor.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW

As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept
up.

Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in
which he is made to look extremely fierce.

San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment.

<b>                          SAN DE
</b>
              He was an amazing monk...

              Yeah, what's up with him?
<b>                          SAN DE

San De walks away, and Drew follows him.
<b>INT. SAN DE'S CHAMBERS ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE BREWING TEA.
</b>The room is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in
a place of honor.
San De    puts the tea    leaves into the pot, then soaks them with boiling
water.    He pours the    water out, then repeats the process several
times.    His movements    are all very precise and careful ­ it almost
looks    like a martial    art kata.
<b>
</b><b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while
           meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction
           we all have to fight against.
San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.
<b>                 SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for
           betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the
           ground.
                 (beat)
           From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even
           the leaves look like eyelids.
San De shows Drew a tea leaf.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Impossible.

<b>                    SAN DE

           Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your
           will is strong.

The tea is ready, and San De begins to pour for Drew.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           I understand you've been questioning some of the
           teachings of the temple...

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           It's just not the way I was taught...

San De keeps pouring into Drew's cup. It is getting to the rim. San
De is not stopping.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Master! Stop! No more will go in!

San De continues pouring until the tea runs all over the table.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have
           learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first
           empty your cup?
He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now
pours into the empty cup.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free

Drew nods and sips at his tea.
<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING A SOFT STYLE OF
</b><b>SHAOLIN WU SHU.
</b>His body moves with the wind, bending and swaying. Another monk is
attacking him with a hard style, and the soft style is very
effective.
Drew and Li try it, and Drew is having a lot of trouble. He is used
to training hard style, and the soft style seems too weak for him.
D.S. comes over.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           It's not fighting ­ I feel like I'm dancing or
           something... This soft stuff is unnatural ­ Fighting
           should be hard, tough...

The D.S. holds out his hand, in a tight fist.

<b>                       D.S.
</b>
           If my hand was always like this, what would you call it?

           Deformed.

He opens his hand, letting it go limp.

<b>                       D.S.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

Li.

</b>As soon as they are out, the serious faces break into smiles, and
they are teenagers again. Some of the disciples run off to join
relatives waiting for them in the courtyard, while a group of them
stick together.
Drew is walking with Li, Wu and several others.

<b>ANGLE ON THE GROUP
</b>
As they walk through the small town outside of the temple.

They pass by Ashema's stand, but only the Bau Bau is there.

Drew bows to the Bau Bau, then slips off his hat, rubbing his bald
head for Bau Bau to see. Bau Bau laughs, and the rest of the guys
rush up to Drew, forcing his hat back on his head.

<b>                     LI

           Drew! We're not supposed to...

<b>                     DREW

He bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off.

They walk through the small town, checking it out.
They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom.

Drew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around.

a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope. Drew stops to

They all shake their heads.
Drew nods his.
They continue to shake their heads.
Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the
same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead.

           We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is
           the most serious rule of the temple.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           It's a stupid rule, Li. But...
He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path
to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to
her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes
and his hat.
Li starts running after Drew. The others follow.

She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives
and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her.
Li arrives and pulls them apart.

He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is
looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is
embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling.

Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but
Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again.
He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently.

Drew smiles, knowing that he has them.

An OOOH escapes from the guys.

Giggles now. Drew pulls his boom box out of his backpack, and starts
searching for a suitable tape.

</b>
              You guys grab a pillow for a partner, while I find some
              slow music.

The disciples have grabbed their pillows. Drew pops the cassette into
his boom box and turns it on, low and sultry.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Just move in time to the music, nothing elaborate. Think

The disciples move and sway in time to the music. They are treating
their pillows like imaginary girls.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TWO BODIES FIGHTING, KICKING AND PUNCHING.
</b>
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew and Gao going at it. The other
disciples are paired off as well, but the only real action is here in
this ring.

Drew is getting tagged, hard, while the points he scores are all
relatively controlled. After one particularly powerful shot, Drew
stops.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I thought this was light contact!

<b>                     GAO
</b>
           Fight, you coward!
Drew stares at Gao, then looks around for the D.S. He is over at the
other side of the training area.
<b>                     DREW
</b>
           You got it.
Before he can move, however, Gao attacks, slamming him full power in
the face. Drew almost falls to the ground, then attacks him and the
battle is joined.
The fighting is fast and furious, and soon the others see what is
happening, and gather around. One of the monks comes over and tries
to break it up, but they continue fighting, wrestling, kicking and
punching.

The D.S. finally gets over to them, and without moving a muscle,
barks ­
<b>
</b><b>                      D.S.
</b>           Stop!
Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring
daggers at each other.

</b>                   (to others)
           Back to work.
He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him.
Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once.
<b>INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY

San De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts
it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           So soon?

                   (beat)

           Tell me what happened.

Drew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that
is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           It was my fault. I started it.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Surprised at Drew's confession.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Disciple Gao was better than me.
Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who nods his head and looks at Drew.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Is this true, Disciple Gao?
Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him,
nodding for him to say yes.
<b>
</b><b>                      GAO
</b>           Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>           I didn't think you were...
                    (beat)
           The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We
           challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other.
           Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be
           able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet
           express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch
           or kick in anger.
                    (beat)
           Shake hands and let your emotions go.

Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept
away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.

They shake hands.

Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is
occupying a place of honor.

<b>                      SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple.
           It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle
           of understanding.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           The best fighter?

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of
           being a Shaolin monk.
<b>                      GAO
</b>
           Yours?
San De nods.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Return to your training.
Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door.
They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they
jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.

Finally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao.
<b>                      DREW
</b><b>
</b>              Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...
Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he
punches him in the stomach.

He leads them towards the window of their dorm, but stops when he
gets there. He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone.

<b>                          DREW (CONT'D)

There is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and
comes jogging towards them.

Suddenly, a figure lands on the ground with a PUFF of dust.

In a crouch, Drew scans the area, then motions for the others to jump
down.

Immediately, other figures land with PUFFs of dust all around him. As
soon as they have all landed, they move off.

<b>ANGLE ON GROUP
</b>As they    sneak    through the courtyards and training areas of the
temple.    They    are about halfway across from the front door of the
temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and
bobbing    ­ he    looks drunk.

Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple?
They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk
makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a
tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and
Gao are standing, but he walks on.

<b>                          GAO
</b><b>
</b>                 (whisper)
           Drunken Kung Fu...
Drew nods and leads them out of the temple.
<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT

</b><b>BEING FREE AND A.W.O.L.
</b><b>EXT. GIRL'S SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF FRONT OF GIRL'S SCHOOL.
</b>It is the same school where Drew first met Ashema. The guys, still
happy, arrive at the school, and the realization of what they are
about to do sinks in.

They stop talking and are staring at the building. Drew starts toward
the door, and nobody follows his lead. He stops and motions for them
to join him. Nobody moves.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Are we men or are we sheep?

A beat, then the entire group bellows:

<b>                    GROUP
</b>
<b>           SHEEP!
</b>
And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making
noises like sheep.

<b>INT. PARTY ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARTY.
</b>
It isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the
other. The music is bad Chinese rock and roll.

The only ones together are Drew and Ashema, who are talking in the
center of the room. The disciples are all clustered together, staring
at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing
around Drew and Ashema.
A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room,
observing everything that's going on.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA
</b><b>                    DREW
</b>           Great party...

Ashema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going
to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a
cassette tape, gives it to Ashema
<b>
</b><b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Play this when I signal, OK?
She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come
over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of
           China...
He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           This is Gao. And this wild man is Li...
Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing
them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired
off, he motions to Ashema.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Hit it!

INSERT of Ashema's finger on the tape player "PLAY" button.

<b>ANGLE ON THE ROOM
</b>
As the song the disciples have been singing in the fields blasts out.
Immediately, the disciples start moving with the music, and suddenly
the

Party is happening.

<b>                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
</b>
Who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody ­ some holding the
girls closer than others. Drew and Ashema are locked in an embrace,
their eyes closed.

A hand comes in and taps Drew on the shoulder.
<b>                      DREW
</b>                    (eyes still closed)
           Not now, Li...
The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.

Drew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough
guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What can I do for you?
<b>                      TOUGH
</b><b>
</b>           Leave.
<b>ANGLE ON DISCIPLES.
</b>They have noticed what is going on.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b><b>                      DREW
</b>           No, thanks.
He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls,
away from danger.
The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs
has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping
over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of
him.

Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Can't we talk this over?

The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by
two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.

Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.

It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room
ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.

The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch.

The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the
room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at
the top of her lungs for them to stop.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>
As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running
past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed.

</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT AS THE LAST DISCIPLE CLIMBS THROUGH THE WINDOW ­ IT

</b>He lands on the hardwood floor, panting his lungs out after the run.
After a BEAT, he lifts his head and looks right at Gao.
<b>
</b><b>                      DREW
</b>              Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?
The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing.
<b>INT. DINNER ROOM ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A
</b><b>TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR
</b><b>SIGNS OF WARNING.
</b>Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their
training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training.
<b>                      GAO
</b>              I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole
              day!

<b>                      LI
</b>
              We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we
              get away with it?

<b>                      DREW
</b>
              I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already
              gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.

<b>ANGLE ON WU
</b>
Who pushes his dinner away from him.

<b>                      WU
</b>
              I've lost my appetite.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
              Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our
              stories in case they seperate us...

He gets up to leave, and the others follow him.
<b>                      LI
</b>
              Seperate us?
<b>EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>IN THE COURTYARD ARE SEVERAL POLICEMEN, WAITING AROUND.
</b>Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm
room.

</b><b>DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC.
</b>
<b>                      DREW
</b><b>
</b>           Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?
Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the
room, his face serious.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber...
He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow
Drew.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Just Drew.
Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S.
<b>INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS.
</b>
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The
Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just
sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it
for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when
Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.

<b>                     HEADMISTRESS
</b>
           He's the one!

<b>                     SAN DE
</b>
           Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?

Drew can only nod.

<b>                     SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           The police have also come. A morals violation is what
           brought them...

Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"
<b>                     POLICE LIEUTENANT
</b>           We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!
<b>                     POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He
           must leave.
They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of
the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who is staring down into the abyss.
<b>                     SAN DE
</b><b>
</b>           This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we
           will have to take under advisement ­ but we will handle
           matters of this temple.
<b>                    POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized
           to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight,
           where he will be held until he leaves the country.
San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Master, may I?
                 (San De nods)
           We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our
           ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure.
           Can we do that?

The police don't have an easy answer to that.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You are wise. You know what is right and what is not
           right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong.
           Who will teach him if we do not?

This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress
will not keep quiet, however.

<b>                    HEADMISTRESS
</b>
           He does not belong here!

<b>                    DREW
</b>
                 (whisper)
           Chill out, honey!
Drew catches a hard look from the D.S.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from
           that which he so desperately needs?
She is about to speak, but thinks better of it.
San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought
           this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight
<b>
</b>           knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.
<b>                      POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>           You will not have to.
The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his
hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes
back to face Drew.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you
           both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen
           again.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the
           morning.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           But I thought... the police...

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
           You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal,
           but you cannot stay.

Drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between San De and the
D.S. His eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           I'm sorry, Master.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           As am I.
Drew gets up and walks out of the chamber.

They are shocked.
<b>                      GAO

<b>
</b>Drew shrugs and goes over to his bed, lying down with a sigh.
<b>                     LI
</b>           The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for
           what happens.
<b>                     WU
</b>           It's not fair.

<b>INT. DORM ROOM ­ MORNING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WAKING UP TO AN EMPTY ROOM.
</b>
Everyone is gone already, their beds made up. Drew gets up quickly
and gathers up his few things. He puts on his New

York Yankees cap and shoulders his back pack, then looks around the
room one last time.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I hate long goodbyes anyway...

He exits the room.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Walking through the courtyard, for the last time. Only a few monks
are around, and they don't meet Drew's eyes.
The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to
those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door.
<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he leaves the temple. He pauses for a moment with the door open,
then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is
completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back
and starts out.
As he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper, he
sees...
<b>THE ENTIRE CLASS OF DISCIPLES
</b><b>
</b>Dressed in street clothes with their bags packed. Li and Gao are in
the front, their bags in their hands, smiling.
<b>                    GAO

<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (smiling)
           I'm with you!
A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In
the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this.
<b>INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE'S CHAMBER, SAN DE WAITING FOR DREW IN ONE

The door opens and Drew walks in, the D.S. can be seen in the b.g.
San De indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in. He does.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Quite a show of solidarity, yes?

Drew nods, trying to hide a smile. He is trying his best to appear
humble.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?

<b>                    DREW
</b>
                 (caught off guard)

           To train, Master.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for
           your inability to learn and progress?
No response from Drew, who is just looking down at the ground.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I
           thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight
           with the ways of the temple, the battle is within
           yourself.
<b>                    DREW

<b>                    SAN DE

                 (beat)

<b>                    SAN DE

</b>           Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of
           trouble!
They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as
one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell.
Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound.
<b>                    LI

<b>                    DREW

           me crazy...
Gao and Li look at each other, nodding.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

<b>                    GAO

<b>                    DREW

Gao and Li nod, and Drew walks with them, shaking his head.

<b>EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ MORNING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ASHEMA STANDING NEXT TO THE STREAM, WATCHING THE
</b><b>WATER RUSH BY.
</b>
In the b.g. comes Drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his
head. He is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk.

Drew walks up to Ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that
for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something.
Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I
           will... miss you and remember you... always.

Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head
against Drew's shoulder.

<b>                    ASHEMA
</b>           Are they making you do this?
She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to
hear it.

Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It
would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.

<b>                    DREW
</b>           No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...
He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He
holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last
long look at Ashema, walks away.

He tries the same set of moves, falls again. Instead    of being angry,
Drew just laughs at himself, then climbs back up on    the poles.

As he goes through a thicket of bamboo. as he gets to the center, he
is attacked! The staff comes out, but Drew manages to block it with
one of the buckets. The staff strikes again, and Drew blocks again! A
third time, and Drew raises both buckets over his head to block it ­
and drenches himself with the water. Then, the staff hits him in the
stomach.

His attacker has vanished, leaving Drew alternately moaning from the
pain, and chuckling at himself in the bamboo.
<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND LI
</b>As they go through a very intricate, beautifully staged series of
techniques. The last technique is a very powerful kick, and one which
Drew is to block using the blocking technique he refused to learn
before.

This time, the kick is thrown and Drew blocks it with the new
technique, sending Li pitching to the ground is a cloud of dust.

Drew turns around and high-fives Gao.

laughter.
<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ DAY
</b><b>TIGHT SHOT OF D.S.' ARM
</b>Gao's hands are around his elbow, pulling down.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Using your muscles, bend my arm.
Gao pulls down, while the D.S. tries to fight back with his muscles,
but finally, after great strain, his arm bends. A cheer goes up from
the group.
D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his
place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a
deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.

Gao looks questioning at the D.S.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           What if I hurt him?

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You will not.

Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the
old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting
all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his
expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.

Gao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on
the other side of the monk.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           Grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance.
Drew and Gao shrug at each other and take an arm. They pull and push,
straining and groaning, but there is no movement from the old monk.
It is like he is a heavy stone.
They give up, and the D.S. bows to the old monk.
<b>                    D.S. (CONT'D)

points at his chest.
<b>                       D.S.
</b>           Try to hit me here with your feet.
<b>                       DREW

off. From out of nowhere comes the staff, swinging for Drew.

Drew doesn't jump, but just calmly avoids it. The staff WHOOSHES over
his head. Drew stands up, and the staff comes again, from a different
direction. Drew avoids, and the staff finds empty air again.

Drew goes on with cleaning the plates, a slight smile on his face.
After a BEAT, he looks around, trying to find the attacker. When he
is sure no one is around, he smiles bigger.
<b>                       DREW

<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES WORKING ON THE UNBENDABLE ARM.
</b>
Drew is in the middle, and Gao is straining to bend his relaxed arm.
He is getting the hang of it.

The D.S. walks up with another monk with    a spear. Together, they
position a wooden target. The monk bows    to D.S. and to the rest of
the disciples, then positions the point    of the spear in the hollow of
his neck. He then hands the shaft of the    spear to the D.S.

The D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear,
slowly but surely.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>Amazed.

<b>ANGLE ON THE MONK
</b>The spear is now almost bent double.
With a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target
positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls-eye.

Drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point
is imbedded deep into the wood of the target.

</b><b>EXT. TEMPLE GROUNDS ­ DAY 120 (SPRING TIME)
</b><b>TIGHT SHOT OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR.
</b>Set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere ­ but the
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Shaolin Temple "forest of stupa",
where the disciples are having a pick up football game ­ it's Sunday,
the disciples' afternoon off. The football spins into the hands of
Gao, who drops it.
Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make
the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over).
Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time
Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown.
Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the
ball.
They are playing some more, having a great time. This time Drew goes
out for a pass, with Gao playing defense. Li throws the pass, and Gao
intercepts. Drew, laughing, goes after Gao.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who goes long for a pass, which Gao lets fly.

It is immediately obvious that it is way too long.

Who is walking along through the stupa, meditating as he walks.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW

Who stops running and sees san de. the ball is going towards San De.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE

The ball is heading right for his HEAD!

<b>ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND OTHERS
</b>
They are bracing for the impact, and the trouble it will cause.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional
receiver. He holds the ball and looks right at Drew, a very stern
look on his face.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Expecting the worst.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>His stern face now taking on a mischevious look. He hefts the ball
and puts his fingers on the laces.

<b>                       SAN DE
</b><b>
</b>           Go long.
Drew pauses for a moment, not sure    what San De said, until San De
motions with his left hand, like a    NFL quarterback, for Drew to go
out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket.
San De throws the ball to him in a    perfect spiral, to a spot where
Gao has no play on the throw, and    Drew catches it in stride.
San De immediately returns to his meditation, while Drew and the
others stand around dumbstruck.
<b>EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO, LI AND DREW RUNNING THROUGH THE
</b><b>COUNTRYSIDE.
</b>They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young
woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes
soaked.

Without thinking twice, Drew allows her to get on his back and
carries her across the river. He deposits her on the other side and
then continues running.

Gao and Li run up next to Drew, and together they go back to the
temple. When they stop outside the temple, they are breathing
heavily. finally catching his breath, Gao turns to Drew.

<b>                       GAO
</b>
           I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream!
           After all the trouble you got into...

           Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that
           kind of thing...

Drew smiles slightly.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still
           carrying her?
He turns and walks away, leaving Li and Gao to puzzle that one out.
As he walks away, San De comes out from behind a pillar where he had
been sweeping, smiling and nodding his head at Drew's answer.

</b>Who are squared    off and fighting. They are intense, and the
techniques they    are throwing are full power. Drew hits Gao, and he
bends over. Drew    closes, thinking that he has Gao at his mercy. At
the last minute,    Gao stands up and cold cocks Drew, who sags to the
<b>
</b>ground.
<b>TIGHT ON DREW

<b>                      DREW

He comes at Gao, and they start fighting again, throwing all kinds of
acrobatic kicks and techniques.

A gong sounds, O.S., and Gao and Drew stop, bow to each other, and
then embrace, smiling.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)

Drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water, and to towel off.
As he rubs his neck, D.S. comes up to him.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>           San De wants to see you, in his chambers.

Drew raises his eyebrows, then looks over at Gao and Li. He rolls up
his towel and snaps Gao with it as he walks by.

San De takes out a map of the area.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           You must return within three day... or don't bother to

</b>He goes over to a drink stand, and buys a cool drink. Just as he is
about to drink it down, it is KNOCKED from his hand.
Drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader ­ the one
who hit the glass. They are yelling at Drew in Chinese, which he
doesn't understand.
<b>                    DREW
</b>
           OK, boys, just let me get my glass and...
Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and
the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the
<b>
</b>ground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on
him.
A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles
this situation.
The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch,
hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew
tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and
drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick
dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.
They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in
pity.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

<b>ANGLE ON THE THUGS
</b>
Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded
down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take
the things from them, and start to walk off.

The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending
him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the
thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face.

Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his
wrist, stopping it.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Oh, I don't think so...

<b>ANGLE ON THE CROWD
</b>
It's getting good now.
The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non-
violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the
fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using
incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the
little boy    and his father.

Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy
and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy,
looking deep into his eyes.
A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin".
Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He
moves on, the crowd watching him walk away.

<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE.
</b>
He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on
his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he
strips off his clothes and dives into the lake.

As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see
a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.

Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked ­
he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore
as he can without coming out of the water.

The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has
on. She is very sexy.

<b>                      DREW

put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him.
He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.

</b>           Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with

He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his
clothes, running up the path away from the lake.

<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE.
</b>
Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment,
then takes a drink of water from the well out front.

Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air
brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of
AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple,
jostling Drew from side to side.

<b>                    TOURIST 1

           Not another temple!

<b>                    GUIDE
</b>
           You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.
The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after
them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk,
and turn back to Drew.
<b>                    TOURIST 1
</b>           A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!

The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The
cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the
<b>
</b>first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him,
he raises his hands up to his face and bows.
<b>                    DREW

He then turns and walks away.

<b>EXT. WATERFALL ­ EARLY MORNING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.
</b>
Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his
expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get
where he is going.

Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then
starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall
is incedible ­ steep and deadly.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching
him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but
surely.

He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp.
Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.

Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can
jump from place to place and make it across.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Just like at the temple...
He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the
others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.
He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.
He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head
of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!
Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the
stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.
He continues across, more careful this time.

arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope
bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces
himself to look straight ahead.
He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns
around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Is this rope strong enough for both of us?
No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is
inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go
quicker.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)

The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope
snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW

Who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of
his pocket and goes up in the air.

Drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and PIN the scroll
to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.

He has his hand out to Drew for help.

Who doesn't know what to do. If he tries to save the scroll, the man
might fall. If he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.

</b>           The scroll that is in this box is more precious than

He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           What the heck...
Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.
Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.
<b>ANGLE ON BOX

As Drew pulls him up onto his back, and carries him up the rope to
the other side of the gorge.

He walks into the hut.

littered around the room.

He shakes his head and starts for the front door.

<b>EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ SAME EVENING
</b><b>
</b><b>DREW COMES OUT OF THE HUT AND WALKS AROUND TO THE AREA BEHIND THE
</b><b>HUT, HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.
</b>The view is incredible. Drew stands looking at the view, and slowly
becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.
He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Master! I apologize, I did not see you.
The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.
Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I failed, Master. A person was in danger...
The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Of course, you're right. No excuses...

Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his
robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the
temple.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           You have it? How?

The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears
it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           So, I didn't fail, huh?

                 (beat)

           I can ask my question, then?

The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What is the meaning of life?

The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles
on his head and stands up.

<b>                    ARHAT
</b>           What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.
<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (smiling ruefully)
<b>
</b>           I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning
           of life.
He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is
standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.
<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest

<b>                      DREW
</b>           No. American.
<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           I notice the littlest details.
<b>                      DREW
</b>
           How many succeeded?

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>
           A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious
           than human life.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           But, I didn't obey.

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>
                 (smiling slightly)

           At the beginning of your training, you were to obey
           without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must
           learn to question everything, and obey yourself.

Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in
the b.g.

           the temple.

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           The bus.
Drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that
brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve
<b>
</b>and pulls him over to a place behind his hut.
<b>DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT
</b>A road! After all he went through to get there?

Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat.
The Arhat returns the bow.

He walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus

He is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the
temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people
walking out the other way.

The group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the
lake, and the man from the bridge. They are talking together on their
way out.

Smiling as he realizes that it was all a test ­ every moment of it.

</b>They are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           I warn you all, any monk who fails must leave the temple
           forever, and will NEVER be called Shaolin.

San De pauses, letting this remark sink in.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Disciple Drew Carson, as you will return to America, and
           never intended to live as a monk in the temple, you need
           not enter the chamber.

Who rises to the challenge.

</b>
           Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?

San De nods.

           Your request is granted.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>In front of the entrance to the Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S.
are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to
look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b>           What did you do that for?

</b>           My last chance ­ when you come out the other side, we
           will be equals.
Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look
at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes
through.
<b>INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.
</b>Drew pauses for a moment,      examining the room. It is filled with
wooden statues of monks,      all in different fighting positions. The
carvings are precise and      incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open
hands, fists and legs are      fashioned out of hard wood, and they look
very dangerous indeed.

Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT
</b>
As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.

The attacks start ­ from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO
LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.

Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to
the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.

Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,
letting his arms practice for the attacks.

There is fear in his eyes.

He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are
different this time.

Drew is clobbered.

Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is
already bruised and bleeding.
<b>                       DREW
</b>                    (whispering)
           I can't do it.

<b>FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS
</b>
Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing
it out in a breathing exercise.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I am a Shaolin monk.
He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.
Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).
He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,
making his way across.
He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue
comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly
adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.

Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly
spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his
arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.

They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.

As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of
ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,
and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.

He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man
Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out
the door.

Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,
expecting a trap or a trick.

Nothing happens.

He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a
handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.

Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS
right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his
muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.
Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a
dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.
The panel drops lower and lower.
<b>FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,
letting his inner energy take over.
<b>ANGLE ON PANEL
</b>
As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body
completely relaxed.
The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.
The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up
with a hook kick and taps it in the face.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Not this time.
Drew quickly walks through the door.

There are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it
through the chamber, but the majority of them are there. The entire
temple is gathered to watch the ceremony.

San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.

After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements,
including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his
hands

<b>                    SAN DE

Chinese dishes, wine and other foods.

The party gets going and is soon in full gear.

           ... alone.

From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her
and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.

Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.

Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.

Drew kisses that fear away.

<b>ANGLE ON THE CROWD
</b>As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at
the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of
people, comes clear... it is Trevor!

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is stunned.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
Could he have known?

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>
Who spots drew standing near the ring. He walks past him, trying to
place his face. Then, he comes back and walks right up to Drew and
slaps him on the back.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>
           Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way
           around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the
           city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being
           a monk!

Drew is dumbstruck, and Trevor takes advantage of it.

<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>                  (to San De)
           He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew.

           If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after
           this fight, 'Kay?
He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her
rear end.
<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Wish me luck, huh?
He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after
<b>
</b>him. All of the monks are looking at Drew with questioning looks,
everyone that is except for San De.
<b>ANGLE ON THE RING
</b>As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins.
It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is
incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.
Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the
Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.
<b>INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW
</b>Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his
humiliation.

</b>
Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique,
and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND
<b>THE OTHERS.
</b>
The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory.
Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD:

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           I'M NOT DONE!
</b>
The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           I want HIM!

He points right at Drew.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I
           want to learn at the hands of a master!

The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while,
warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin
to face Trevor.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>           I want the American Shaolin!
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>

Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting
hand on his shoulder.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Pointing and yelling for Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b><b>
</b>Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going
crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks
over to Trevor.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You
           humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
           happen again.
<b>                     TREVOR
</b>           So, let's see what you've learned.
<b>                     DREW
</b>                   (shaking his head)
           I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating
           you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be
           defeated, not you.

<b>                     TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           Bull! You're just chicken!

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too
           important for that.

He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.

<b>ANGLE ON CROWD
</b>
They don't know what's going on.

<b>ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS
</b>
They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
</b>Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they
have ever been.
<b>                     TREVOR
</b>
           COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is
standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.
<b>                     SAN DE
</b>
           Do you turn away from him out of fear?
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Who is seething.

<b>                     TREVOR
</b><b>
</b>           I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!
           Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me!
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>His face calm.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for
           my ego.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           You have learned much.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b><b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           You did the right thing.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>
<b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           How about you, baldy? Or you?

He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb
into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look
at Drew.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the
           fighting monks.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>                  (looking at drew)

           What should be done?
<b>                    GAO (CONT'D)
</b>           Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of
           the temple.
San De looks at Drew long and hard.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some
           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to
smile slowly.
<b>                      SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           It's your call.
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still
standing, trying to get someone to fight him.
Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and
Li and together they high-five.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           For the temple...
Drew climbs into the ring.

The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as
he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.
Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him ­ massage,
drinks, etc.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who sits alone in the other corner.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to
give it to Drew.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER
</b>
As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew
(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels
to bring air to him, etc.

The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,
and he motions for them to bow to each other.

<b>                      TREVOR
</b>           Remember last time, punk?
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Nothing exists but the moment, and...
                 (beat)

           ... I'm going to enjoy it.
They back up, and the fight begins.
Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.
<b>
</b>He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy
technique, but he can't touch Drew.
<b>                      TREVOR
</b>           Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.
Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Yelling for the knock out blow.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE
</b>
Worried about this latest development.

Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.

Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.

To teach him a lesson.

Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.

The crowd goes crazy.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Who also get the message.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
</b>Who knew the message all along.

<b>WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING
</b>Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the
side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.
<b>EXT. GREAT WALL ­ MORNING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER
</b><b>HIS SHOULDER.
</b>
He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the
salute, a figure comes toward him.
<b>
</b>It is San De, and he has something in his hands.
Drew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him.
Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,
and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then
his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.
They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there
holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest
of his life shining in the b.g.
<b>ANGLE ON ASHEMA
</b>Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the
Great Wall.

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

<b>               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world

                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

</b>
               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET
</b>
               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

<b>               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH
</b>
               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

<b>               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY
</b>
               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

<b>               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH

               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF

               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing

               There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think 
               may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives 
               gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's 
               the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat

                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by

                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under 
               that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", 
               and in CLOSE-UP&amp;emdash; "Project Vulcan."

<b>               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&amp;emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

</b>                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin

               It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a 
               large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test 
               track very slowly.

               Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving 
               steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin 
               fanning out in a search.

                         out!

               They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, 
               push him off, and assume the controls.

               Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.  
               Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.  
               Austin punches the other one off.

               He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

               TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They 
               are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a 
               fast-approaching car.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&amp;emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.  
               Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his 
               bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

               He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.  
               He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, 
               whose head explodes.

               Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.  
               Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining 
               Fembots.

               Their heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are 
               lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters, 
               flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and

                         a swinging spy from the Sixties, was 
                         unfrozen in the Nineties to battle 
                         his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled 
                         Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear 
                         warhead to the center of the earth 
                         and banished him into space forever. 
                         Or so he thought.

               Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

               Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She 
               rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail. 
               Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

               She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

               A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude 
               Beach". Austin enters from the left.

               The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit

               Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS 
               appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of 
               nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing 
               CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

               A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are 
               blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

               Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out 
               from his waist. Austin looks proud.

               A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier 
               weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND 
               MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

               Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit 
               "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits

</b>                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.

               Everyone is a little grossed out.

</b>                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine 
                         just goes on a little longer than it 
                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, 
                         perform fellatio once and you're a 
                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. 
                         I remember once I was being fisted 
                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where 
                         the story gets interesting. He was 
                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red 
                         meat all night long, but one sip of 
                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I 
                         remember we were caught in fragrance 
                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once 
               quiet.

               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the 
               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and 
               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW 
               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot 
               coffee products.

                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several 
                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
                         flung empire with 2000 outlets 
                         worldwide.

</b>                         If I may continue, I believe if we 
                         shift our resources away from world 
                         domination and focus on providing 
                         premium quality coffee drinks, we 
                         can increase our gross profits 
                         fivefold.

               Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY 
               MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

                         Not only were you actually reading 
                         an article in that Playboy, but a 
                         candy-stripe nurse offering to give 
                         you a sponge bath didn't so much as

               Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

               Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the 
               largest room you've ever seen in your life.

</b>                         We have evidence that Dr. Evil has 
                         developed a time machine.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

</b>                         Our researcher noticed that these 
                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

               Austin burps and swallows it.

</b>                         Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is 
                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also 
                         have a time travel device. After 
                         years of research we've developed a 
                         machine that will transport you back 
                         to the Sixties.

</b>                         So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 
                         and I was frozen in 1967, I could go 
                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?
                              (goes cross-eyed)
                         Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

                         things and just enjoy yourself.

               Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

                         defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time 
                         for tea.

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

                         yeah!

               The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, 
               leaving flaming tread marks.

<b>               FLASH CUT TO:

               The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches 
               to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws 
               the hukka down. Austin hops out.

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

<b>               EXT. PARK - LONDON
</b>
               Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see 
               that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big 
<b>               ARYAN ASSASSIN.
</b>
               PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 
               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of 
               all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. 
               The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

</b>                         Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: 
<b>               "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."
</b>
               Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet 
               Charity or Hair.

               Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we 
               see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE

               Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms 
               outstretched.

               The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

               The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is 
               the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face.

<b>               37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

<b>               INT. CITROEN

               The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole

               Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at 
               him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps 
               out.

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a 
               sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing 
               suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol 
               medallion.

               She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere",

               A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on 
               his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads 
               which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers 
               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth 
               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first 
               kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

               A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against 
               the glass as if trying to reach her.

               Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block 
               his path. Austin is like an animal.

               He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and 
               takes a bite out of it.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE

               disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino

               The TIME PORTAL is fifty feet away. Austin and Felicity run 
               towards it. In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently 
               placed barrels. As they run behind the barrels, an obvious 
               AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE 
               emerge in their place.

               The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross 
               over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic 
               flips and stunts.

               The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed 
               pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place 
               and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999".

               Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other

</b><b>1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
</b>	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
</b>	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
</b>	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
<b>									   SUPERIMPOSE:
</b><b>4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
</b>	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
<b>5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
</b>	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
<b>6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
</b>	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
<b>7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
</b>	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
<b>8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
</b>	   sweep past the moon.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
<b>9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
</b>	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
<b>10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
</b>	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
<b>11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
</b>	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
<b>12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
</b>	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
<b>13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
</b>	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
<b>					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
</b>					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
<b>					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
</b>	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
<b>14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
</b><b>	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
</b>	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
<b>15	 ASH												 15
</b>	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
<b>16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
</b>	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
<b>17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
</b>	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
<b>18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
</b>	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
<b>19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
</b>	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
<b>20	 ASH												 20
</b>	   looks up from the dust to behold...
<b>21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
</b>	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
<b>22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
</b>	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
<b>					   WARRIOR #1
</b>			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
<b>23	 ASH												 23
</b>	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
<b>24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
</b>	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
<b>25	 ARTHUR											   25
</b>	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
<b>26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
</b>	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
<b>27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
</b>	   waves a shaky hand.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
<b>28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
</b>	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
<b>29	 ARTHUR											   29
</b>	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
<b>30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
</b>	   is cut. A thin red gash.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
<b>31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
</b>	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
<b>					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
</b>			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
<b>					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
</b>			   To the pit with the blackard!
<b>32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
</b>	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
<b>33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
</b>	   He tumbles from the horse.
<b>34	 ASH												 34
</b>	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
<b>35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
</b>	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
<b>36	 ASH												 36
</b>	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
<b>37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
</b>	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
<b>38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
</b>	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
<b>39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
</b>	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
<b>40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
</b><b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
<b>41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
</b>	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
<b>42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
</b>	   They are gaining an Ash.
<b>43	 ASH												 43
</b>	   glances behind him.
<b>44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
</b>	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
<b>45	 ASH												 45
</b>	   whips his horse.
<b>					   ASH
</b><b>			   GIDDYPU!
</b><b>46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
</b>	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
<b>	   WHOOSH!!!
</b><b>47	 ASH												 47
</b>	   ducks the blade.
<b>48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
</b>	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
<b>	   THUNK!
</b><b>49	 ASH												 49
</b>	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
<b>	   WHOOSH!
</b>	   ASH looks left...
<b>50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
</b>	   winds up for another blow.
<b>51	 ASH												 51
</b>	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
<b>52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
</b>	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
<b>53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
</b>	   swings.
<b>54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
</b>	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
<b>55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
</b>	   is knocked from his steed.
<b>56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
</b>	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
<b>57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
</b>	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
<b>58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
</b>	   ride at one another.
<b>59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
</b>	   swinging his Broadsword.
<b>60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
</b>	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
<b>61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
</b>	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
<b>62	 ASH												 62
</b>	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
<b>63	 ASH												 63
</b>	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
<b>64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
</b>	   charges and swings his broadsword.
<b>65	 ASH												 65
</b>	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
<b>66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
</b>	   is knocked from his horse.
<b>67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
</b>	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
<b>68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
</b>	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
<b>69	 ASH												 69
</b>	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
<b>70	 ARTHUR											   70
</b>	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
<b>71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
</b>	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No!
<b>72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
</b>	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   To the castle!
<b>73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
</b>	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
<b>74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
</b>	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
</b>	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
</b>	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
<b>					   GOLD TOOTH
</b>			   Move along now!
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
</b>	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

<b>78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
</b>	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
<b>79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
</b><b>	   SHEILA
</b>	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
<b>					   SHEILA
</b>			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
<b>	   SHEILA
</b>	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.

<b>					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1

<b>81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81

<b>82	 ASH												 82
</b>	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering

<b>93	 ASH												 93

<b>141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
</b>	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
<b>142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
</b>	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite

<b>146	ASH												 146

	   from the earthen wall before him.
<b>147	ASH												 147

	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
<b>					   ASH

<b>156	ASH												 156
</b>	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   This is my boomstick. It's a

			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
<b>157	ASH SPINS,										    157
</b>	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
<b>158	ANGLE ON											 158
</b><b>	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
</b>	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it

<b>164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
</b>	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the

	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
<b>165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
</b><b>	   CLOSE UP - ASH
</b>	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner

	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
<b>166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
</b>	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages

<b>					   SHEILA

	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Lady, just leave me alone.
<b>					   SHEILA
</b>			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
<b>					   SHEILA
</b>			   I think not.  I feel that there

			   It is no accident.
<b>166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the

			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for

			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm

	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.

<b>172	ASH												 172
</b>	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
<b>173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173

</b><b>			   YOU SHALL DIE!
</b>	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by

<b>178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178

	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
<b>179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179

<b>193	ASH												 193

<b>194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
</b>	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an

</b><b>	   ASH

	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent

</b>	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which

<b>235	THE EVIL FORCE										235

<b>236	ASH												 236
</b>	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,

<b>261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
</b>	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the

<b>263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263

	   up.

	   He beholds...
<b>264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264

<b>275	ASH												 275

<b>277	ASH												 277
</b>	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a

</b>	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
<b>281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
</b>	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
<b>282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
</b>	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
<b>283	A STARTLED ASH										283

<b>284	ASH												 284
</b>	   snags the horse's reigns.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
<b>285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
</b>	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
<b>286	EXT. MILL											286
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the

<b>287	INT. MILL											287
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
<b>288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
</b>	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
<b>289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
</b>	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror

</b>	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
<b>291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291

	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
<b>292	ASH												 292
</b>	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
<b>293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
</b>	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
<b>294	ASH												 294
</b>	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
<b>295	THE TINY ASHES										295
</b>	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
<b>296	ASH												 296
</b>	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
<b>297	TINY ASH #1										   297

<b>298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298

</b><b>299	THE FORK											 299
</b>	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
<b>300	ASH												 300
</b>	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
<b>301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
</b>	   is pushed off a high shelf.

</b>	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
<b>303	ASH												 303
</b>	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the

	   needles jutting from it.
<b>304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
</b>	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks

	   imps.
<b>305	TINY ASH #2										   305
</b>	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
<b>306	ASH												 306

	   #2 into the stove's fire.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Ooops.
<b>307	TINY ASH #2										   307

<b>309	TINY ASH #3										   309
</b>	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
<b>	   RIP!!
</b><b>310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
</b>	   through Ash's shoe.
<b>311	ASH												 311
</b>	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
<b>312	ASH												 312
</b>	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
<b>313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
</b>	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
<b>314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
</b>	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his

	   air.  As he inhales...
<b>315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
</b>	   is released.
<b>316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316

	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
<b>317	ASH												 317
</b>	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
<b>	   ASH
</b>	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
<b>318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
</b>	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
<b>319	ASH												 319
</b>	   watches in horror as...
<b>320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
</b>	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
<b>321	THE IRON HAND										 321
</b>	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
<b>322	ASH												 322
</b>	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
<b>323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
</b>	   cranks the vice's handle.
<b>324	THE VICE											 324
</b>	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
<b>325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
</b>	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
<b>326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326

	   is super fast motion.
<b>327	ASH												 327

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
<b>328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Soon as I get out of this thing
<b>			   I... YIEEEE!!
</b><b>	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
</b>	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No!  Not the teeth!
<b>	   YANK!
</b><b>329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
</b>	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for

	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
<b>330	ASH'S HEAD										    330

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Where the hell are ya!?
<b>331	THE EVIL HAND										 331

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
<b>332	ASH												 332

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE

</b><b>333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333

<b>334	ASH												 334
</b>	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA

<b>335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
</b><b>	   ASH

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
<b>336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
</b>	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
<b>337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
</b>	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
<b>338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
</b>	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
<b>339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
</b>	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
<b>340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
</b>	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
<b>341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
</b>	   sprout from Ash's body!
<b>342	A LEG											    342
</b>	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
<b>343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
</b>	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
<b>344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
</b>	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
<b>345	BAD ASH.											 345
</b>	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
<b>346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346

<b>					   GOOD ASH
</b>			   What... are you?  Are you me?
<b>					   BAD ASH
</b>			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
<b>					   GOOD ASH
</b>			   Why are you doing this?!
<b>					   BAD ASH
</b>			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
<b>347	EVIL ASH											 347
</b>	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   ...Little goody two-
<b>	   SMACK!
</b>			   ...shoes, little goody two-
<b>	   SMACK!
</b>			   ...shoes, little good--
<b>348	EVIL ASH											 348
</b>	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
<b>	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
</b>	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
<b>349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349

<b>350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
</b>	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
<b>351	GOOD ASH											 351
</b>	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
<b>					   GOOD ASH
</b>			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the

<b>352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
</b>	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
<b>353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
</b>	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
<b>	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
</b><b>354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354

</b><b>357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
</b>	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
<b>358	ASH												 358
</b>	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
	   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
	   task.
<b>359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359

<b>360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
<b>361	ASH												 361
</b>	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
<b>362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
</b>	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
<b>					   EVIL ASH HEAD
</b>			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
<b>					   EVIL ASH HEAD
</b>			   Huh?
<b>363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
</b>	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a

</b>	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
<b>365	ASH												 365
</b>	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
<b>					   ASH
</b>				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
<b>366	ASH												 366
</b>	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
<b>367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
</b>	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   This must be it. The cemetery.
<b>368	ASH												 368
</b>	   moves toward the cemetery.
<b>369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
</b>	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
<b>370	ASH												 370

	   He glances down to...
<b>371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
</b>	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
<b>372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
</b>	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
<b>373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
</b>	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and

<b>374	ASH												 374
</b>	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said

			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about

	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
<b>380	ANGLE ON											 380
</b><b>	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
</b>	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
<b>381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
</b>	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
<b>382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
</b>	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
<b>383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
</b>	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
<b>384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
</b>	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
<b>385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
</b>	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
<b>386	ASH PUPPET										    386
</b>	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
<b>387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
</b>	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
<b>					  ASH
</b>			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
<b>388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
<b>389	THE BOOK											 389
</b>	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
<b>390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
</b>	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
<b>391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
</b>	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
<b>392	THE BATBOOK										   392
</b>	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
<b>393	ASH												 393
</b>	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
<b>394	ASH												 394
</b>	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
<b>395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
</b>	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
<b>396	ASH												 396
</b>	   bristles in fear.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
<b>					   ASH
</b><b>			   KLATOO... VERATA...
</b>			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
<b>397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's
			   cool!  I said the words!  I did!
<b>398	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									398

<b>399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
</b><b>	   A DOOR

	   storm with foreboding.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Something is amiss.
<b>400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
</b>	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
<b>401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
</b>	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
<b>402	A BONEY HAND										  402
</b>	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
<b>403	ASH												 403
</b>	   falls.
<b>404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
</b>	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
<b>405	ASH												 405
</b>	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
<b>406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
</b>	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
<b>407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
</b>	   that rip from the ground!
<b>408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
</b>	   toss Ash to...
<b>409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
</b>	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
<b>410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
</b>	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
<b>411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
</b>	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
<b>412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
</b>	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
<b>413	ASH												 413

<b>414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
</b>	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the

</b>	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.
<b>416	STOP MOTION ANIMATION								   416
</b><b>	   A ROTTED ARM

<b>417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
<b>418	THE ARMS											 418
</b>	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
<b>					   ASH
</b>				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
<b>419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
</b>	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
<b>420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
</b>	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
<b>421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
</b>	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
	   earth.
<b>422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS								   422

	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!
<b>423	EXT. MILL - NIGHT									  423
</b><b>	   ASH

<b>425	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT							425

</b>	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   I'm through bein' their garbage

			   bargain.
	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the

	   He whips his horse...
<b>			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
</b>	   ...and rides off into the darkness.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:

<b>432	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							432

<b>433	ASH												 433
</b>	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
<b>434	ASH												 434
</b>	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Yes. It's just that...
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Just what?!
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the

<b>435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435

<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   No...I sensed something had gone

<b>436	THE CROWD											436
</b>	   murmurs at this bad news.
<b>437	ASH												 437
</b>	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Yeah.  basically.

<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Did you speak the exact words?!
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Well, maybe not every single

			   said them.  Yes.
<b>438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439

<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed

			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   The passage is useless to us as

<b>					   ASH

			   Most of out people have already

</b>	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine

<b>567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
</b>	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.

	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
<b>576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
</b>	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
<b>577	EVIL SHEILA										   577

<b>585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
</b>	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
<b>586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586

	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
<b>591	A FLAME ARROW										 591

	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
<b>592	ASH												 592
</b>	   watches in horror as...

<b>594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
</b>	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.

</b>	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
<b>595	ASH'S SWORD										   595

</b>	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
<b>599	ANGLE ON											 599
</b><b>	   KLANG!
</b>	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
<b>600	ABOVE...											 600
</b><b>	   SKELETON ASH

	   a circle.
<b>604	THE SKELETON										  604
</b>	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
<b>605	ASH												 605
</b>	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
<b>606	EVIL ASH											 606

<b>612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612

<b>613	ASH												 613

	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton

by Ross LaManna

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns
sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's
path.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,
determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a
business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.

Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the
footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds
and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric
strives stubbornly forward.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>1	CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
Eric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.
Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the
cold.

His hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After several
attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of
wood, exhausted and frustrated.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sits
next to it, partially covered in snow himself.

<b>ERIC
</b>
His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a
purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.
The wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting.
<b>									
</b><b>									END DREAM
</b>
<b>2	INT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Eric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a
moment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies
back down.

<b>3	EXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY
</b>
A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a
pipeline support piling:
<b>						
</b><b>			PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
</b><b>				  PRIVATE PROPERTY
</b><b>				  NO   TRESPASSING
</b><b>				  NO	  HUNTING
</b><b>				  NO	 TRAPPING
</b><b>				  NO	 SHOOTING
</b>
<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead
of him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's
confident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have a
distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan
cotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,
windless, forty-degree afternoon.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:
</b>
He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
four-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through the
scope.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,
ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She's
twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue
eyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born
in it.

Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.
But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of
a CO2-powered dart gun.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy
shoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almost
immediately slows, sits, then lies down.

Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing
deeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			What a beauty.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Hand me the transmitter.

Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all
the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.
Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some
photos.

With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			He's coming around fine.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Be right back.  I left my
			camcorder in the car.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
<b>FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
</b>
as she hurries back to their International Scout.  On the
door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,
under which are the words:
<b>						
</b><b>			NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.
</b>
Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.

<b>ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF
</b>
Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,
glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking through
the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline
piling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Anne Marie!  Stop!

She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the
dead leaves and gravel.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Don't move.

Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With
a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne
Marie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Goddamn trappers!

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Takes nerve, laying traplines on
			restricted land.

Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3	CONTINUED:  (3)
</b>
Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
Haul Road.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			What are you doing?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			He still might be around.  I saw
			fresh tire tracks coming in.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric hurries down the footpegs.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Man and a jeep, about a mile and
			a half down.

He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.

<b>4	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.

<b>5	EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES and
another Trapper appears nearby.

<b>6	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It's
oddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen.  They zoom off.

<b>7	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his
view but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust.



<b>8	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
His entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long red
hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Where the fuck did you drop
			Corbett off?

In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
looks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,
confrontation is not his style.

He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
creek.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			He's over there.

<b>9	EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard
against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.
LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the
mud.

Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.

<b>10   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Eric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay here.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Be careful -- there're two of
			them.

Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			If I unzip my parka, stick this
			out the window.

<b>11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>11   CONTINUED:
</b>
Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long
huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.

He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's
eyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton
coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt is
a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.

Eric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone as
formidable as Corbett.

<b>12   INT. / EXT. JEEP
</b>
Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			No shooting.  Let's see who's so
			interested in us.

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his
traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(to Corbett)
			Ain't worth it, Ben...

<b>13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT
</b>
As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've
been a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You got two counts against you --
			trapping out of season and
			poaching on restricted land.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Can't be much of a crime, if all
			they got minding the area is a
			cocky kid.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I got your plate number, asshole.
			Maybe you feel like spending a
			few months in jail.

Corbett just smiles.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>13   CONTINUED:
</b>
But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep
window.

Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly
unzips his parka.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Ben?  Sure you don't want me to
			drop the fucker?

Corbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he looks
past Eric at the Scout.

<b>CORBETT'S POV
</b>
The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
Marie's backing him up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You leave and don't come back,
			that's the end of it.

After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away
from Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.

Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat.

<b>ANGLE ON TRAPPERS
</b>
Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.
LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.
While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.

<b>14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING
</b>
Eric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes
on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.

The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the
driver's seat, and they take off.

<b>15   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>15   CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(unnerved)
			Great idea -- pointing a lousy
			dart gun at some nut with a
			high-powered hunting rifle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Bastards took off, though, didn't
			they?

<b>16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.
Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.

<b>17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the
window.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			All this fuckin' land, and we're
			locked out.  Makes me puke.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Jawing about it won't change it.

<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Then don't look to your left.

<b>18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
bend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other
garbage.

Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.
They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops.

LeMalle grabs his carbine.

</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Leave it here.

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(pats Mitchell's shoulder)
			Relax.  I just want to ask them
			how the hunting is.

<b>20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
Corbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,
their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.

The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He
walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,
Corbett smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Looks like you've had some luck.
			Where's your guide?
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>			We're on our own, if it's any of
			your damn business.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(re ermine)
			You did real good.

He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(to Corbett)
			No swinging shit.  They're over
			their goddamned limit.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Sportsmen)
			My friend is right.  Supposed to
			have a licensed guide when you're
			on this land, too.
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>			Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit
			fees.

LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire.  No one
notices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips his
parka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>20   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #2
</b>			I were you, I'd drive right on
			outta here again.  Now.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(calmly)
			This was my roaming land, 'til
			the government took it over.
			Only Innuit can hunt here now,
			and tourists, like you.

Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
the Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to
him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			According to tribal law, hunters
			passing through the land of
			another tribe can only take game
			to survive.  They can eat the
			meat, but have to surrender the
			hides.

LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
ermine.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Want the meat?
<b>					
</b><b>					SPORTSMAN #1
</b>
			Fuck you, dirtball.

Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.

<b>WIDER
</b>
LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
Land Rover, many still in their packages.  He helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with
			their shiny new car.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			If you're gonna take something,
			take it and let's go.

Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.

</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>20   CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol.  He swings it toward LeMalle.

LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.

There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.

Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.

Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum
six-shooter in his hand.

Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting
Corbett.  Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies the
weapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.

Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses to
LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.  After a moment:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Sportsmen)
			Put him in your truck.  Smell of
			blood will attract the bears.
			(to trappers)
			Let's go.

As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that
he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.

Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>
			I don't believe in leavin'
			witnesses behind, Ben.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			It was self defense.  Leave it at
			that.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			You think those fucks will tell
			it that way?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(ending the argument)
			We'll get a head start before
			they go crying to the law.

Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into the
engine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>20   CONTINUED:  (3)
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; to Sportsmen)
			You can pack out of here -- two,
			three days' hike along this river
			at most.  Weather should hold
			this early in the season.

Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.

<b>LEMALLE
</b>
isn't yet satisfied.  He walks back over to the Sportsmen,
kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right
beside them.  Intimidated, Sportsman #2 looks away, but
LeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Think I'm pretty?  You better
			forget how we look, 'cause next
			time they won't keep me from
			killing you.  This land ain't
			quite civilized, you know...

He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices across
the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned and
sickened.

<b>ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
Corbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			At least he scalped the dead one.

<b>21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK
</b>
Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town
squats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the
Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the
prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is
long gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter.

Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled and
horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.  Facing it

are a mud-walled fire bath, a wooden steam bath called a
Maqi, six one-room cabins for let, and an unused dance hall.

LEO MEYERLING opens the tailgate of a Dodge truck with the
Northland Petroleum logo and "District Supervisor" on the
door.  Meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face.  He staples a poster on a wall.  It has a
picture of him on it, and:
<b>						
</b><b>				LEO MEYERLING

				  State Legislature
<b>			 VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND!
</b>
<b>22   EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.

<b>23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell."  There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window.

The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is short
and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(wary)
			Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and
			I'd like to keep it that way.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(conciliatory)
			Just passing through.

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses
behind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store.

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.  Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>23   CONTINUED:

			Needs patching.

</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Twenty-five dollar.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(smiles)
			Sure have learned to worship the
			white man's god.

Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out.  Corbett pays
him.  Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the
corkboard.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I hope I can count on you
			gentlemen to vote for The
			People's Friend this November.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Share some of that oil company
			money in your pocket and you can.

Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on
the wall.  LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the
poster between Meyerling's spread fingers.  Meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder for
support.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Meyerling)
			One flier comes loose and I shoot
			you for littering.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(exiting; grudgeless)
			Have your fun... just remember

<b>24   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON VALLEY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

An early STORM has blown in from the north, bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain.

<b>25   INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.  LeMalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunches
over a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.

Mitchell glances at LeMalle, then at Corbett.

<b>26   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - "THE TURTLE" - DAY
</b>
The winds have died down.  The rain has turned to a light
snow.

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul
Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires.
The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.

An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.
The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle,
therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens.
Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.
<b>

			Bet you're right.  But I didn't

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- We appreciate the company.
			Anne Marie's getting cabin fever
			already.

Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree --
this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			What'd you say they call these
			spaceships?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
<b>

Looking past Wilder, Eric points out some smoke on the
horizon.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>27   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Everything seems peaceful enough.  The SOS fire (made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke) has burnt down to embers.

Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.

The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover,
but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers.  In the
back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.

Something is amiss.  Eric shoots a look of trepidation at
Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup.   Wilder pulls the
door of the Land Rover open.

A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground.  His eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips.  His skin is
blue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)

Startled, Eric steps back.  Anne Marie gasps with horror.
Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listens
for a heartbeat.  Nothing.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze
			to death.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			It's not even winter!
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			They got wet in the rain.  Core
			body temperature dropped, got

			what was happening.

Eric stares at the dead Sportsmen.

</b><b>27   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			Question is why they sat here
			when the storm moved in.  Check
			their stuff while I sniff around.

Wilder tries the ignition.  The starter TURNS OVER, but the
engine makes a horrendous GRINDING.  He walks to the front
of the vehicle.  Noticing the bullet holes in the grille, he
bends down for a closer look.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies.  Still in their packages are some matchbox-sized
ELT locating beacons.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			They had Emergency Locater
			Transmitters, but didn't use
			them.
			(opens one up; shakes his
				head)
			Maybe because they didn't bring
			batteries.

<b>CLOSE
</b>
Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover.  She pulls
back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third
Sportsman.  The torn red flesh on his head and his
bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight.

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away.

<b>28   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LAND ROVER
</b>
Eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath.

Wilder looks at the third Sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the Land Rover.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I'm too old for this shit.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Any idea who could've done it?

Sourly, Wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the
vehicle.

Wilder examines the Sportsman, finding the bullet hole in
his chest.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			Even for Ben Corbett, this is
			nasty.  Man's got balls.  He was
			sitting in Devil's Cauldron when

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Thank God.  You can arrest him.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Not necessarily.  Corbett's awful
			hardbitten these days.

Wilder leans against the Land Rover, feeling tired.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			His old roaming area's all
			private reserve now.  Normally,
			long as he stays civil in my
			jurisdiction, I let him be.

Eric looks hard at the dead Sportsmen.
<b>

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE

The town is quiet.



<b>30   INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker, DIXIE.

He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.  Eric holds
Corbett's boots, which have been repaired.  Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett.  There is a flash of recognition between
them.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Ben Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Yep.  Afraid you have me at a
			disadvantage.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Kenai at the general store asked
			me to bring these.  Didn't expect
			we'd already met.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			No big deal.  We just got off on
			the wrong foot.  What's your
			name?

Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the
floor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on top
of it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interest
in it.  He leans back and smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Desmond.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			New to the country, kid?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Six months.  Ecological study for
			Northland Oil.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Ecology.  Folks use that term for
			everything but what it means:
			who's eating who.

Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and
gets out of the tub.  His sinewy body, resembling a
scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.  He
wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric.

Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a
revolver, which Eric has been hiding inside one of the
boots.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; smiling)
			You wouldn't shoot anyone...
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER (OS)
</b>			But I would.

<b>NEW ANGLE

Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Corbett
with a 12-gauge shotgun.  He kicks Corbett's magnum out of
reach.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			All this for laying traps on
			private land?
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			You left a footprint at the
			Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty
			sight there, Ben, 'cause the two
			men you didn't shoot and mutilate
			died of exposure.

Corbett shakes his head but remains implacable.

Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbett's
duffel bag cradled in his arm.  Handcuffed, Corbett walks in
front of him.

Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he
goes by.  Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles.

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nice bluff the other day with the
			tranquilizer gun out your jeep

as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town.  They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower.  Mounted above the shack, a DC wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze.  From
within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV.  Wilder
KNOCKS on the door.

ARTHUR NEFF, a pasty-white, 45-year-old ex-Texan, pulls the
door open.  His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett.

<b>33   INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

Neff just stares at Corbett.

In one room, there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley

of an iron-bar door is securely cemented to the log walls.
Wilder comes in with Corbett and locks him in the cell.

</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Mind if I get some stuff from my
			kit?

Wilder does mind.  He locks the duffel bag and Corbett's .44
in his desk drawer.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Sam, listen -- I shot to defend
			my man.  Other guy drew first.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			If that was all, fine.  But
			carving him up, stranding the
			others, that's too fucking much.
			Is everything that walks, crawls,
			flies or swims fair game to you?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(softly)
			I'll get loose before that plane
			comes.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Don't try me.  I'll kill you if

As Eric walks into Kenai's general store, Neff hurries over.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Mr. Desmond!
			(grins; sticks his hand
				out)
			Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the
			Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Sure.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Snowplow, generator, TV dish...

			Channel!  Here, this is for you.

He hands Eric a piece of styrofoam shaped like a commode
seat.

			Warm to forty below.  Remember,

			Neff.

<b>36   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - NIGHT
</b>
The storm has passed.   A faint CHUGGING emanates from the
small orange generator trailer behind the Turtle.  Eric
pulls up and parks the Scout.

<b>37   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's
research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies.
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and
white prints.  All are of man-made objects whose presence is
juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.

Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at
the door and kisses him.  Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped
package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's
preparing dinner.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Did you catch Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Sure did.  He was one of the
			trappers we rousted from the Haul
			Road.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Was there any trouble?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			He was sitting in a hot tub with
			a hooker.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Going after killers isn't the
			same as chasing poachers, Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(grins)
			Can't help myself.  Corbett's
			type always pisses me off.
			(hands her the package)
			Oh, I found this at the post
			office.  Had your name on it.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>37   CONTINUED:
</b>
Perplexed, she looks at the return address --
Bloomingdale's.  Delighted, she tears it open.  Inside is a
pretty, elegant dress.  Anne Marie kisses him.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You were looking at it in the
			catalog.  Don't know where you
			can wear it...
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I'll wear it for you.  And I can
			wear it when we go home.  We
			won't be here forever.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(frowning)
			You make it sound like a prison
			sentence.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			That's not what I meant.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			It's exactly what you meant.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Look, why get into this again.
			As long as it's working, let's
			leave it alone.  It's been nice
			so far.  We're together --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- Permanently?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(sighs)
			Do I want to be with you
			permanently?  Yes, I think I do.
			But be with what you do and the
			way you live?  That I don't know.
			C'mon, Eric, until I met you,
			coming back to Alaska was totally

			out of the question for me.  But
			I'm here.  I'm getting great
			pictures, and I'm having fun.
			(slips her arms around him)
			I love you.
			(kisses him)
			So shut up and let's eat.



<b>38   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</b>
An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and
parks.  With an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth, "VIKING"
BOB CORBETT gets out and stretches.  He's 38, six-foot-six,
with sandy hair, beard, ruddy skin, and his brother's dark
eyes.

He looks around for some sign of life.  He spots Neff
tending one of the windmills and walks over to him.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			I'm looking for some trappers.
			Ben Corbett, Mitchell, LeMalle.
			Seen 'em?
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Yesterday.  Said they were going
			to Cache.  They were thirsty, but
			we were voted dry.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Shit.

As Viking Bob walks back to his station wagon, he notices
Kenai poking around in front of Wilder's cabin.

<b>VIKING BOB'S POV
</b>
Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilder's typical bush-country
front yard.  Piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps,
stove parts, saw horses, 55-gallon drums, dismantled snow
machines, wash tubs, tires, etc.

Bunching his collar around his neck, Kenai shivers and sorts
through Corbett's traps.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Viking Bob ambles over to Kenai.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			These yours?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Gonna make an offer.  Man who
			owns them won't need them where
			he's going.

<b>39   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob, then turns
to Corbett.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>39   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Back against the bars.  Now.

Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face,
covering his mouth.

Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips
outside.

As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge.

<b>40   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
The look on Wilder's face tells Kenai to shut up.  Viking
Bob realizes something's up.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Your brother and the boys left me
			some traps to sell for them.
			They're gone --
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			-- To Cache.  So I heard.  Ben
			never said nothing to me about
			selling his gear.

<b>41   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth.  He pries one
of his boots off and kicks it through a window.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Bob!  They got me on a murder
			charge!

<b>42   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Wilder pulls his .357 out.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Sorry, Bob.  I'll have to keep
			you here 'til I ship him south.

Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then
punching him in the gut.  Wilder sprawls among the junk,
dropping his revolver.  Kenai freezes, not about to take
sides.

Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for
his .357. Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>42   CONTINUED:
</b>
He dives into his station wagon and starts it up.  As he
drives past, Wilder POPS off a few rounds, but Viking Bob
keeps going.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Kenai helps Wilder up.  Pissed, Wilder shoves him against
the cabin.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(continuing)
			You stupid, greedy, loudmouth
			sonofabitch!  He'll have the
			others here in a few hours.  You
			fucked me up, now you're gonna
			help me move him.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			(shakes head)
			Forget it, Sam.  I never work for
			free.

<b>43   INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT
</b>
Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES.
On the monitor, it SHOWS footage of the traps under the
pipeline piling.  Eric comes out of the back module holding
two ELT pendants.  He glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I still can't believe I'm being
			financed by an oil company.
			Especially when they get a look
			at these pictures.  Technology in
			the wilderness; not too pretty.
			(re ELTs)
			What's that?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I thought I should check our
			emergency transmitters.

Eric activates the ELT's.  They emit an SOS pattern of radio
waves -- three short, three long and three short.  This is
visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Marie's video
<b>MONITOR.
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Avalanche season is coming.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>43   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Winter.  Two straight months of
			night -- we may never get out of
			bed.
			(kisses him)
			Which would suit me fine.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Prolonged darkness makes people
			crazy.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Not me.  I'm equipped.

She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the
room lights.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			Allow me to give you a practical
			demonstration of low-light
			infrared photography...

She does so by seductively undressing for the camera.  She's
SEEN on the MONITOR, illuminated by the "light" from the hot
stove.  Eric appreciates the show.  He crawls toward her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			High-tech in the wilderness.
			Gets me excited, too.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Come here...

Laughing, he wrestles her to the rug.

<b>44   EXT.  HILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</b>
There is a full moon and a clear night sky.  Viking Bob's
station wagon is parked out of sight.  He sits inside,
waiting.

He hears an ENGINE starting in the distance.  Sitting up, he
grabs some binoculars.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
Wilder's extended cab truck pulls out, heading west.

<b>45   EXT.  FOOTHILLS - NIGHT
</b>
In the bright moonlight, two people are seen in Wilder's
truck as it speeds along a dirt road.

Viking Bob follows at a discreet distance, headlights off.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>45   CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Viking Bob turns and takes the literal high road -- a narrow
trail above the roadway that Wilder's truck is on.

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry, then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush.

As Wilder's truck approaches, Viking Bob turns on his bright
lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun.

Wilder's truck screeches to a stop.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Kenai gets out with his hands up.

Viking Bob slowly approaches Wilder's truck.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Ben?

No answer.  Viking Bob looks in the cab.  Kenai's passenger
is Dixie, the Inupiat hooker.  Viking Bob grabs Kenai and
pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(continuing)
			Where's Ben Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			I have no argument with you, Bob.
			Wilder said I could keep his
			truck if I drove it ten miles
			away from town.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Where did they go?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			He didn't say, but I would guess
			the opposite way from here.

Viking Bob shoves Kenai against the truck, then punches him
for good measure.  Cussing, he runs back to his station
wagon and drives off.

<b>46   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE - NIGHT

Eric and Anne Marie are asleep.  Eric starts awake at the OS
sound of a high-pitched vehicle HORN and an approaching
<b>ENGINE.
</b>



<b>47   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric pulls the door open.  Wilder is untying Corbett from
the snowmobile.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I got an emergency on my hands.

Corbett smiles at Eric as he walks inside.

<b>48   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric, Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module.  Anne
Marie, nervous, wearing a down robe, serves coffee.  She
stares at Corbett, trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor
with what she saw that afternoon.  Corbett smiles at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Eric)
			...You give us a ride in the
			Cessna you got hangared at the
			pumping station, we'll be in
			Fairbanks in a few hours.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			That's what we should've done in

<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I could've sat tight for the

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Wilder; re Anne Marie)
			A lot to ask, dragging him away
			from such a good-looking girl --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(irritated)
			-- To take you to jail?  It'll be
			my pleasure.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(to Eric)
			You better get some sleep.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Good idea.  Flying over mountains
			can give you some nasty

			the clouds might have a big rock
			inside it.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>48   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

			I'll get you there all right.

Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module, leaving Wilder
with his prisoner.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>49   INT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder.  Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.

Corbett is awake.  He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him.  He eyes Wilder's .357.  It's in a lefty Sam Browne
holster.  No way to take it without waking Wilder.

Corbett stands and inches toward the door.  As he pulls it
open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.

Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			Goddammit, I don't need this
			aggravation.  I'll shoot you,
			Ben.  Bank on it.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			I'm not too old to knock the snot
			out of you!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nothing personal.

Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands
are in front of him.  He reaches for his .357.  Corbett
butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.  Amazingly,
Wilder stays on his feet.

Corbett hurries back to the door.  Wilder lunges,
bull-determined to hold onto him.  Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands.  Wilder goes down
hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there.
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing.  But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module,
Corbett flees.



<b>50   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE
</b>
Eric is pulling on his pants.

<b>51   INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
</b>
Eric rushes in.  The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor.   His holster is empty.  Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder.

Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment, coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle.  Unfamiliar with weapons, Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle.

<b>52   EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Corbett is trying to start Eric's Scout.

Eric fires a loud warning SHOT from the Turtle doorway.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You want to try that handgun
			against this rifle, go ahead.

Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment, weighing his
odds.  He takes his hands off the steering wheel...

Eric SHOOTS again, this time SMASHING the side-view mirror
and window next to Corbett's head.

Still handcuffed, Corbett gets out of the Scout.  Holding
the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the
Scout.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Some day you might have to face
			me without a gun.

<b>53   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Eric leads Corbett in.  Anne Marie is cradling Wilder's
head. She's crying.  Eric looks at Wilder.  There is blood
coming from his ear and he's fading fast.
<b>					
</b><b>					WILDER
</b>			(thickly)
			Fetch him back?
			(Eric nods)
			Don't let him walk...

Eric nods again.  Wilder holds his gaze on Eric, then simply
stops breathing.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>53   CONTINUED:
</b>
Eric is stunned.  Quietly, Corbett sits down.  Clutching the
rifle, Eric sits on the floor and glares at Corbett.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(softly)
			Does he have people?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(after a beat)
			A daughter in Oregon.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Send him down to her.  There's
			money in my duffel bag, back at
			his cabin.

Corbett's benign attitude is chilling.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I better call in.

He turns the shortwave radio on.  It SPARKS and burns out.
The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Thought of everything, huh?
<b>					
</b>
<b>					CORBETT
</b>			Surviving is what I know --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- Killing is what you know.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Pack some food while I prep for
			the flight.
			(off her look)
			I'm sure not gonna let him go.

Covering Corbett with the rifle, Eric handcuffs him to the
sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit.

<b>54   EXT.  CACHE, ALASKA - (MOVING SHOT) - NIGHT
</b>
Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt
road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead.

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the
Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's
Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several
taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>54   CONTINUED:
</b>
Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the
streets, drinking and socializing.  With only a couple feet
of snow on the ground, this is still summertime.  Under
storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete.

Viking Bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other
trappers.  He spots their jeep in front of a
dangerous-looking saloon called the "Bear Sign Inn."

<b>ANGLE WITH VIKING BOB
</b>
as he parks and gets out of his station wagon.  He hears a
familiar VOICE around the side of the building.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE (OS)
</b>			C'mon, girl, talk to me,
			negotiate with me...

<b>55   EXT.  CACHE - ALLEY
</b>
Drunk, LeMalle stands in an alley with a bored, acne-scarred
Oriental PROSTITUTE.  He weaves and leers, his hand stuck
inside her blouse.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			LeMalle.  We got a problem.
			Where's Mitchell?
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's
			inside, boring bastard...

Grumbling, Viking Bob separates LeMalle from the Prostitute
and drags him by the collar out of the alley.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>56   INT.  BEAR SIGN INN - NIGHT

Meyerling's campaign posters cover the walls.  Many have
been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd.

In a booth covered with grafitti, Mitchell squints and works
on his scrimshaw.  LeMalle, somewhat sober, eats a plate of
muktuk -- whale blubber.  Viking Bob pours him more coffee.

Wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky.

Eric comes out of the Turtle, leaving the front door ajar.
He throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the Scout.

<b>58   INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit.
Terrified about being alone with Corbett, Anne Marie
cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			How long have you been up north?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE

Anne Marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but Corbett is
so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite
herself.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			My dad was a Navy doctor.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Knew you had no native blood,

</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			She's dead.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Oh.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Had some good years.  Met her in
			'66.  She showed up one day in
			Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One
			Sunday morning, she marched into
			a bar and announced she was

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			How did she..?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

Anne Marie shudders.  Smiling good-naturedly, Corbett looks
around, spotting the package Anne Marie's new dress came in.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			What about you -- why come back?
			Classy girl like you seems more
			suited to the finer things.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			That's why I left, moved to
			Washington.  When I met Eric I
			was doing day shoots -- products
			and fashion, mostly.  Pretty
			dull.  Eric was teaching college,
			and then he got the job with
			Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay
			together, so we talked them into
			funding some wilderness
			photography... and here I am.

As she's talking, the Turtle ROCKS slightly.  She looks out
the tiny window.

<b>HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW
</b>
Eric is putting Wilder's body inside an enclosed storage
compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Horrified, Anne Marie turns away.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You should know something.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I don't want to talk any more.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

He carefully stuffs Wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores
Anne Marie's disparaging look as he does.

</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>


<b>60   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK - DAWN
</b>
Eric and Corbett drive toward the deserted pumping station.
They cross over a prefabricated steel portal bridge spanning
a fast-running creek.

<b>61   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
The wind whips through the shot-out wing window.  Corbett's
handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon
rope.

<b>62   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
The pumping station consists of three corrugated steel
buildings.  The largest is an airplane hangar.

Just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip
running parallel to the Haul Road.

<b>63   INT.  SCOUT - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric pulls up to the hangar.  Suddenly, LeMalle steps out
from behind the building.

<b>64   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
LeMalle recognizes the International Scout.  He swings his
rifle up to stop it.

Eric slams it in reverse and SCREECHES back around the
hangar.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL (OS)
</b>			Aim for the tires!

LeMalle FIRES as the Scout rounds the corner.  He hits a
fender, doing no damage.  Angry, he runs after the vehicle.

<b>65   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric slams on the brakes and turns the Scout around.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Let me out and keep going.  They
			catch us, they'll kill you.

Eric doesn't need any convincing of that.  He tears out.

<b>66   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of
the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker.  Steam HISSES out of the
radiator.  Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost
hitting him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>66   CONTINUED:
</b>
Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle.  One
of the Scout's back tires gets blown out.

<b>67   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric slows, shifts into four-wheel drive and continues,
driving on the rim.

<b>68   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Chewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to
Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep.  They pile in.

<b>69   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle.

<b>70   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it
disappears from sight over a hill.

<b>71   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek.  They come over the
rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed,
below the Haul Road.  Above, the trappers speed past without
noticing.

After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend,
Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back
over the bridge.

<b>72   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Eric stops the vehicle.  He grabs a five-gallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back.

<b>73   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army
Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the
pipeline.  Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and
the honeycombed underside of the bridge.  He puts the rag
inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs
like hell back to the Scout.



<b>74   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
The trappers realize their quarry is missing.  Viking Bob
slams on the brakes and looks around.

<b>75   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric speeds away.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			They'll still catch us.  All
			you're doing is pissing them off.

<b>76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment.

<b>77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
The trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn
around and head toward it.

<b>78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR
</b>
Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip.

With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.

The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a
Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve.

<b>79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank.

<b>80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.

<b>81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from
the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the
water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable.



<b>82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use.

<b>83   EXT.  HAUL ROAD &amp; FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration.
He climbs into the driver's seat.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Get in.  We can jump it.

They hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start,
REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the
bridge.

As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar
supports crumple.

The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes
airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in
space.

LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth.

<b>84   INT.  HANGAR
</b>
Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip.

<b>85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path.
They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip.

<b>86   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
It picks up speed and takes off.

<b>ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Below, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads.
LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down.

<b>87   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him.



<b>88   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
Viking Bob watches, wide-eyed with fury.  Mitchell spits.
LeMalle punches the wall.  Then he turns and repeatedly
BLASTS the Scout, parked nearby, with his carbine.

<b>89   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			How the hell were they smart
			enough to find us?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm
			sitting in this plane and they're
			down there blowing me kisses.

Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure
of the controls.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Been driving long?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I needed a pilot's license to
			take the job here, so I got one
			in six weeks.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			That makes the flight more
			interesting.

Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
landscape all the more immediate.

Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open,
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			See the blood?  Pack of wolves
			took down a moose.  Greedy,
			gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd
			kill the last wolf on earth,
			right in front of the President
			of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly
			predator, the wolf.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>89   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Sounds like professional
			jealousy.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hunting and trapping was a damn
			fine life.
			(beat)
			Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,
			we were teams.  I'd always go
			with Mitchell.  Good man,
			Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry
			about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire
			a plane in October.  On the way
			to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
			we'd drop supplies.  We'd land,
			tell the pilot to come back for
			us a few days before Christmas.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			The idea was to get to the
			supplies before the bears did.
			Along the route we'd set our
			traps.  Made our year's living in
			three months.

Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
the tree line.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Lot of times we didn't even have
			a landing strip.  We'd set down
			on a plateau, like that one
			there.  Yeah, that one's easy;
			you could glide right in...

Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot.

The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
jamming it on.

<b>90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is
instantly discharged.



<b>91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.

Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too
fast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Hope you got your money's worth
			on those lessons.

<b>92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
plateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau
comes up fast.

The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the
wind.

It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly,
flipping tail over nose.

<b>93   INT.  CESSNA
</b>
It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed.

Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.

Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
wrenching his ankle.

<b>94   EXT.  CESSNA
</b>
Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his
supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett
crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the
plane.

A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the Cessna EXPLODES.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the
powdery snow, clutching at his ankle.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>94   CONTINUED:
</b>
Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he
can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He
lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's
midsection.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay put!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You got the belly to look me in
			the eye and pull the trigger?

Eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Be no different than shooting a
			rabid dog.

The men face off for a tense moment.

Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the
tension.  Letting the hammer down, Eric looks back at the
burning plane.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Next time you want to kill
			yourself, don't include me.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I took the odds on getting down
			in one piece, and I made it.  Now
			we're in my territory.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			With light clothing and no
			supplies, this is nobody's
			territory.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You sound like the tourists.
			Know-it-alls who read about
			survival in a magazine.  Fuck
			you.  You won't make it off this
			mountain.

Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry
to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck
and wraps his ankle with it.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Let's go.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>94   CONTINUED:  (2)
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(re Eric's ankle)
			I'm not gonna carry you out of
			here.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			That's right.  You're not.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Look, take these cuffs off.  We
			need to work together.
<b>					
</b>
<b>					ERIC
</b>			Forget it.

Eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the
sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an
approximation of their direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Last time I checked the flight
			plan, we were forty miles
			northeast of Devil's Cauldron.
			Southwest is that way.  No sense
			waiting for a goddamn taxi.

Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he
shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett
frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his
arms cuffed tightly behind his back.

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett
enjoys the view.  And waits.

<b>95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,
Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,
snow-covered mile behind them.

Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the
rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well
be in a desert.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>95   CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			It'll be interesting, trying to
			build a fire without any wood.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Welcome to the environment, Mr.
			Ecology.  Out here, one mistake
			is all you get.

Determined and dour, Eric pushes on.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Why in hell you care enough about
			me to die taking me in?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I don't plan on dying.

It's all academic.  The sheer magnitude of the surroundings
makes them feel they're the only people in the world.
<b>									
</b><b>									DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>96   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK
</b>
The sun drops behind the mountains.  A wind whips up,
chilling the men through their clothing.  Eric tries not to
shiver.  He spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it, making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll stop here, dig out a snow
			shelter.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig.
			I'll have a little sit-down.

Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near
the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every
move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Even in the drifts, this snow's
			too powdery to make a shelter.
			When you're done jerking around,
			reach down the back of my coat.

Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down
through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>96   CONTINUED:
</b>
folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner
eyeholes.  He shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open...
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>97   EXT.  NYLON SHELTER - EVENING
</b>
Eric and Corbett have stretched the tarp out tent-style next
to the granite rock formation, making a minimal but
functional refuge from the cold night.

<b>98   INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
The men huddle inside the tarp.  Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.  It's swollen to the
size of a softball.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Still quite a hike to Devil's
			Cauldron.
			(beat)
			Days.  A long stretch to go
			without sleep, my friend.  You
			can hide behind that pistol for
			now, but take your eyes off me
			long enough to sneeze --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- Turn around.

While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the
granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning.
<b>									
</b><b>									FADE TO:
</b>
<b>99   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - DREAM  - (AS IN SCENE 3)
</b>
Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit,
following the predator's paw prints in the snow.  He peers
ahead and his prey becomes visible.  But it isn't a wolf,
it's Corbett.  His hands and face are covered in blood.
<b>									
</b><b>									END DREAM
</b>
<b>100  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN
</b>
The sun peeks over the mountain tops, drenching them with
light and color.



<b>101  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
The light hits Eric's eyes.  He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep.  Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.  He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture.
<b>									
</b><b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>102  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY
</b>
Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path.  It's simple -- to continue, they have
to cross it.  Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular
hurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the
drop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Ice is too thin -- you can see
			the water moving underneath.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We're not sitting here 'til
			November.  There's a cargo plane
			coming to Devil's Cauldron in
			four days, and I'm putting you on
			it.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			We get wet, we freeze to death in
			a couple hours.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I've been on ice like this when I
			was a kid, skating.  Spread your
			weight, keep moving.  Go on.

Corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by
someone with a Master's Degree.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(gestures 'you first')
			Be my guest.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(points .357)
			I'm right behind you.

Frowning, Corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches
across the fifteen feet to the other bank.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
He turns and, indeed, Eric is right behind him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>102  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Wait 'til I'm across!

Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner.  He keeps
coming.  The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight.

Corbett is three feet from solid ground.  He drops to his
knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the
way.

Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across.  The ice
makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
air holes.

Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.

Eric crawls doubletime.  He makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Eric sits on some rocks.  Corbett glares it him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Most dangerous thing in the
			world: A regular Joe, in over his
			head.  You trying to prove how
			tough you are for me, or for
			yourself?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			It wasn't my idea to crash the
			plane.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Let's camp.  There's grayling
			under this ice. I'll snare some
			for dinner.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(standing)
			We've got another two hours of
			daylight.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Pushing it is flat wrong.  All
			you prove is your ignorance about
			breaking trail.

Eric is not convinced.   Grumbling, Corbett gets up and
takes the lead as they continue southward.



<b>103  INT.  THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY
</b>
Trying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the
darkroom she's made from the front bathroom.  She glances at
her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return.

<b>104  INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
</b>
Anne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up
to dry.  Outside, (OS), a car HORN blares a couple of times.
Grinning, she runs to the door.

<b>105  EXT. / INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up.  Anne Marie comes outside.
Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric.  As Meyerling
climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's
snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I've been trying to raise you on
			the shortwave for two days.

He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Have you talked to Eric?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I have not, but I very much want
			to.  What do you know about the

<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I was hoping you had some news --
<b>					
</b>
<b>					MEYERLING
</b>			-- Get this straight: I'm the
			District Supervisor.  Whatever
			you do reflects on me.  It wasn't
			my idea to bring you people up
			here, but I'm stuck with you.
			You are absolutely not to involve
			yourself in any local disputes.
			Whichever side you take, you
			alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett
			is quite well-known in this

</b><b>105  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I don't care if Ben Corbett makes

			Understood?

Anne Marie just glares at him.  Meyerling examines the
damaged shortwave.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			What happened here?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			The radio's on the fritz.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Where'd you say Eric is?
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Somewhere along the pipeline.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			What about that hotheaded

			was in the middle of this mess.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Sam?  We haven't seen him.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Really.  I thought maybe that was

			(beat)
			By the way -- your truck also 'on
			the fritz?'
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(blanching)
			Why?
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			It's out by the pumping station,
			shot full of holes.

Noting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he
crosses to the door.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			Still nothing to tell me?
			(no reply)
			Suit yourself.



<b>106  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
Eric limps further down from the mountains.  Corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum.  As their altitude
decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation.

Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance.  The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated.  Picture the most rustic, overwhelming
wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.

<b>NEW ANGLE - LATER
</b>
The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a
sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear.
Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Have to backtrack, find another
			way down.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Forget it.  It would take days.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(assessing the drop)
			Going to be a bit of a challenge
			with handcuffs on.

Eric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric
cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready,
he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from
Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from
Corbett's tarp.

<b>ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER
</b>
Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon
rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum
footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.

Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path.
Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes
his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold
and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the
dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.

He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger.
Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric
is right above him.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>106  CONTINUED:
</b>
Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand
instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.

The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air.
Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his
leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold
of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.

Corbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them
both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst.

After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go
of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the
granite.

<b>107  EXT.  TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
top of some foothills.  Now and again he glances behind,
gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's
carelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.
Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming
down from the north.

But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.
The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a few
thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
brush to thick coniferous forest.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Better get into those trees
			before that squall blows down.

Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the
foothills.

Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.  They ram
each other with six-foot-wide antlers.

Corbett stares, transfixed, admiring.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You talk about ecology -- there
			it is.

Eric turns, surprised at Corbett's unabashed awe.

Catching the men's smell the moose bound away, and the spell
is broken.

<b>108  EXT.  MINING SETTLEMENT - EVENING
</b>
Viking Bob, Mitchell and LeMalle head somberly back to
Cache.  They drive along a hydraulic gold mining sluice on a
nearby river and come into town.

As the trappers park their jeep, some MINERS greet them,
shouting over the ROAR of the water.

Outside, a STORM rages.  LeMalle is drunk, but still able to
stuff himself with a thick steak.  Mitchell drums his
fingers and listens to everyone talk.  With them at the bar
are the Miners, LOGGERS, CAT SKINNERS (bulldozer drivers)
and some leathery WOMEN.

threesome hastily exit, leaving behind the hat full of
money.

<b>111  EXT.  FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING
</b>
The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures.
Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion.
Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
enemy.  The snow and wind cut through their clothing like
razors.  They poke around for dead wood with which to make a
fire.  The trees are small and healthy; little is found.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(shouts over WIND)
			Just gather birch.  It'll smoke
			like hell, but it'll burn green.

Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches
from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed
arms.

They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree
trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm.  Hunching against
the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
pocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so cold
he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.

Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his
hands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takes
the remaining matches from Eric.

Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match
between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holds
the flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fire
immediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against his
fingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takes
hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.

On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.
Eric can't control his shivering.  He gets on his knees next
to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the
wind.  Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not

to grow.  Relieved, Eric and Corbett look at each other with
a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect.

The fire, now unattended, is smoky as Corbett predicted, but
burns along nicely.
<b>									
</b><b>									END MONTAGE
</b>
<b>112  EXT. / INT.  NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT
</b>
Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.  The STORM
rages outside.  Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner.

Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.  A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.

Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.  Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease.

<b>113  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			I need your pocket knife.
			(Eric hesitates)
			I have to eat, too.

After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.  Smiling,
Corbett admires the fancy knife.  Then, BELOW FRAME, he
skins and guts his catch.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Damn lucky this storm didn't blow
			down when we were on those
			baldheaded mountains.  It
			continues, we better stay put.
<b>

</b>			It could blow over tomorrow, too.

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You know Meyerling?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss
			your ass with precision if
			there's a vote in it.


Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style.  Raw.  He uses the
knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth,
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice.
Eric stares, disgusted.  Off his look:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Always eat your meat raw when the
			weather's cold.  Does you more
			good, long as the entrails look
			clean.

Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood
from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open,
next to his leg.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'll hold onto that.

With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric.
While Eric eats his dinner, Corbett listens to the STORM and
watches him eat.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

Eric ponders Corbett's words as he eats.

			...John Byers was hospitalized in

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.  Someone is outside.
Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window.

No sign of a vehicle or a person.  As she pulls on her
parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall, but doesn't touch it.

<b>115  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle.  Anne
Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion -- Wilder.  Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
pounds, it's used to having its way.  Right now, it's
hungry.

With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture
the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the

utility compartment.  The bear pokes its head inside, and
Wilder's body slumps out into the snow.  The bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout.  Salivating, it prepares to dig
in.

Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT.
Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked
against the side of the Turtle.  She inches toward it.
Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.

Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys.  They're not there.  She feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares.

Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wields
the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.

The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation
meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat.  As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>115  CONTINUED:
</b>
Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear.  It grunts when
the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards.  Anne Marie
throws another flare.  With a ROAR from hell, the bear
charges.  Anne Marie falls back.  Still holding the last
flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle.

<b>ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground.  The bear
swipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at
the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome.

She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
Turtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't
budge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet
snout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve:
<b>					
</b><b>					?  DANGER!!
</b><b>					
</b><b>					?  BLACK WATER
</b><b>					
</b><b>					?  UNTREATED SEWAGE
</b>
Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort,
it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLING
unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.  Greatly
offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest.

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging
from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.

</b>
<b>116  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
</b>
Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center
of three similarly-sized trees.  A FLARE supplies the light.
The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her.

She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground.  Then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>116  CONTINUED:
</b>
She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between
the other two.  She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to
the cross-length rope.

Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches.  The flare
burns out, plunging the area into darkness.

Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to LIGHT another flare.  As she does, the
forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres.
Seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the Turtle.

</b>
<b>117  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAY
</b>
The storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes.  Eric and Corbett trek
toward Devil's Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest.
Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses.  Eric, using a
tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore
ankle.  For the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			There's a cabin, maybe twenty

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(bristling)
			You don't get it, do you?

Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face.  Eric falls
backwards into the snow.  Corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit.  Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.

			Stop!

Corbett bounds through the snow, dodging trees and
snow-covered rocks.

Eric squeezes off a SHOT, and is startled by the recoil and
the blast.  He scrambles to his feet and SHOOTS again.

Corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank.

<b>NEW ANGLE - FOLLOW CORBETT
</b>
Corbett runs over a frozen stream, invisible under a cover
of snow.  Suddenly, the ice SHATTERS under him.  Corbett is
immersed in frigid, waist-deep water.  He gasps from the
sudden temperature drop.

hobbles after him, CUSSING bitterly to himself.

<b>CORBETT

crawls to solid ground.  Disoriented from the shock to his
system, he rolls over to catch his breath.

<b>WIDER

Eric appears over a snowbank.

Corbett tries to run, but his frozen, waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron.  Stumbling and panting, he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream.  Eric easily catches up to him.
Corbett sits in the snow, shivering.  He looks up as Eric
trots over.

Eric glares at Corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Nothing personal.  Just wanted to
			see what you'd do.

Noticing Corbett's sopping legs, Eric becomes furious.
<b>

The sun sinks below the horizon, creating across the
mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows.  The wind
<b>HOWLS.
</b>
<b>119  INT.  NYLON SHELTER
</b>
Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter.  Corbett's
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it.  He
huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and
listless.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Stay awake!  You want to go
			hypothermic?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			If that means freeze my balls
			off, no thanks.
			(yawns)
			I'll be okay.

Eric examines him.  Corbett's skin is white and rigid, his
lips are pale blue.  He scowls at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Told you I'm fine!
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC

			How many do you see?

			What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You don't feel cold?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			It's a spring day...

He starts to doze off.  The shivering he's been repressing
now racks his body.  Eric sits him up, closer to the fire,
and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders.  With his
foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to

Corbett's legs.  Eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't
enough.  Eric loathes the specter of death, even Corbett's.
He shakes him, trying to keep him awake.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Wake up, goddammit!  You've got
			classic hypothermia --
			crankiness, fatigue, can't feel
			your coldness.  Worst thing you
			can do is fade out.

Corbett is headed someplace far away.  Sighing, Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire.  He unbuttons Corbett's
shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett.
Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.  Corbett's
teeth chatter.  He's completely unconscious.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			One more thing -- this doesn't
			mean we're going steady.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:

Later, Corbett rests fitfully.  It could go either way.
Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:

It's night.  Some color has returned to Corbett's skin.
Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt.  His eyes open.  He tries to sit up, but he's too
weak.

Flashlight in hand, wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie
refuels the generator.  Something catches her eye --

Anne Marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away.

She hurries back into the Turtle.

Anne Marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable.

The vehicle gets closer.  It's the trappers' jeep.  It slows
and parks on the Haul Road next to the Turtle.

Anne Marie peers out the window.  She gasps as she
recognizes the jeep.  Ducking from sight below the window,
she grabs Eric's coat and hurries into the rear module.

Mitchell stays in the jeep.  Viking Bob and LeMalle get out
and walk cautiously toward the Turtle.

LeMalle stands midway between the jeep and the Turtle,
cradling his carbine.  Viking Bob goes up the steps.

Anne Marie remembers something she should've taken with her:
the rifle.  Too late.  She hears Viking Bob's FOOTSTEPS (OS)
come up the wooden stairs outside.

Viking Bob knocks on the front door.  He peers through the
sheer curtain on the window, into the front module.

He shrugs to the others, then tries the door.  It's
unlocked.

Mitchell gets out of the jeep, spits and follows the others
in, his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his
leg.

Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.  She closes it
behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear
module.

The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is

up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to
determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if

In the back, Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow, then climbs into
the utility compartment where Wilder's body was stored.

A moment later, LeMalle comes around the corner.  He notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior night's visit.

Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle.  They point
their flashlights around, spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods.

Tense and silent, the trappers follow the marks.  A breeze
RUSTLES the needles of the evergreens around them.  They
stop at the point the footprints end.  A rhythmic CREAKING
above them makes LeMalle shine his light upward.

The light REVEALS Wilder's feet swinging back and forth

equipment.  She stops as she hears the trappers' boots (OS)
CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle.

<b>131  INT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at
the comfortable surroundings.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			I should get me a job with an oil
			company.

He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving
tools out on the coffee table.  LeMalle helps himself in the
well-stocked larder.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I say we eat, torch this fuckin'
			thing, and move on.

LeMalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh
bottle of Scotch.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Go easy.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Cool out.  I ain't about to get

<b>132  EXT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles
outside.  He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies
and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank.
Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility
compartment inflicted by the bear.

He walks to it, stepping over the bear scat.  He marvels at
the size and depth of the clawmarks.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>132  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Big mother musta wanted something
			real bad in here...

LeMalle tries the door, but it's jammed shut.  He tucks his
flashlight under his arm and gives another tug.  This time
the door cracks open.

<b>CLOSER - HIS POV
</b>
He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in.
A pair of eyes stare back at him.

<b>WIDER
</b>
LeMalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife.   He
tries the door again.  It WRENCHES open...

...He's looking at his own face in one of Anne Marie's
mirrored photo reflector boards.

Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment.  Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items
out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the
snow.  Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie,
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment.

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy.  Leaving
the door hanging open, he wanders away.

<b>133  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE
</b>
After he's gone, Anne Marie reaches over and closes the
door.  She can hear the trappers' (OS) CONVERSATION inside:
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB (OS)
</b>			I know in my gut he was here.
			First light, we try to get scent
			of his trail.

Sighing, Anne Marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and
tries to get comfortable.  It's going to be a long night.

<b>134  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAWN

Eric and Corbett wearily trudge through the woods.  Corbett
has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth.  As he
walks, he sniffs at one of Eric's Eskimo potato roots and
takes a tentative nibble.

They walk in silence.  Corbett tightens the tarp against the
cold air and looks at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Don't judge me.  You're a joke,

He shoves Eric with his handcuffed hands.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Tell me what I should do,
			Professor.  You got all the
			answers.  I shouldn't hunt?
			Fine, I'll just phone up and have

Livid, Eric backs away and knocks Corbett's hands away from
him.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Don't push me..!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Cowardly bastard.  I'm in
			handcuffs and I still scare the
			piss out of you.

Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels
back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously
throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into
Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams
his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow.

Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They
wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's
about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

			First you save my ass, now you
			want to kill me.  Make up your

Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett.  Corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence.

<b>135  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY
</b>
Sunday morning.  Chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the Devil's Cauldron valley.

A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN ("We Will Gather at the
River") plays through a PA system, ECHOING forlornly off the
hills.  The PEOPLE of Devil's Cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement.  Some, older Women
mostly, head for the dance hall, where the HYMN originates.

<b>136  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
The Women SING along with the HYMN.  They face a shelf
holding the PA, a rusty TV and record player.  And, in front
of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit.

<b>137  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON
</b>
The Men, including Neff, split off from their mates and go
into the Maqi.

<b>138  INT.  MAQI
</b>
Neff joins some other Men sweating on benches in the
primitive steam bath.   Kenai sits closest to the fire.  His
thick glasses are steamed up, but he finally looks warm.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Wilder's missing church services;
			you believe it?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			I just as soon he stay gone.
			Fool could've got us all killed,

<b>139  EXT.  FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY
</b>
Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of
foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town
comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from
below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			What makes you so sure my boys
			won't be waiting for us?
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>139  CONTINUED:

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I already have.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You don't know how true that is.

Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll wait here until nightfall.
			No fire, no tarp.

Corbett sits next to him.  After a long moment:
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Didn't mean it, you being a
			coward.  You're a lot of things,

			but chickenshit isn't one of
			them.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you
			what scares me -- stumbling
			through life, like an ordinary
			jerk.  That's why I want to work
			on the front lines, where what I
			do means something.
			(beat)
			Soon as I got here, I realized my

			(beat)
			I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am

<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT

</b><b>					
</b>					CORBETT (Cont'd)
			I ever saw.  We're like Eskimos

The men listen to the faint MUSIC echoing through the silent
foothills.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; softly)
			My wife used to go to chapel on
			Sundays.  See her friends, 'cause
			I was away so much.
			(beat)
			Should've been home that day.
			She'd be getting dressed right

Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses
Corbett's face.

<b>140  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY
</b>
The trappers file out the front door.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			My guess is he's loose and
			heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll
			need supplies; that's the closest
			settlement without a lawman.

LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him
disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the
jeep.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I ain't gonna leave a seven-
			hundred-dollar Remington behind.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(exasperated)
			What you gonna do with it?  Large
			bore's for shit on small game.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Not in the right hands it ain't.

To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip,
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle,
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>140  CONTINUED:
</b>
Pleased, LeMalle slams back the bolt, ejecting a spent
shell.  He glances curiously at the door of the utility
compartment and starts toward it.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(continuing)
			Thought that door was open last
			night...
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Quit fucking around.  Get in.

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob
driving, they pull away.

<b>141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the
window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.

<b>142  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator.
The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on
the rear module of the Turtle.

The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob
hurries on to more important business.

<b>143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE
</b>
As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie
clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb
with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the
flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling
bracket.

<b>144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and
lurches the front module away from the burning rear module.
She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears,
watches the rear module BURNING.
<b>									
</b><b>									DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>145  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</b>
Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen.  They look at one another
-- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago.  No one
seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin.



<b>146  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's dark.  Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not
noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there.  He
blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again.

<b>147  INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE
</b>
Neff pries himself from his MTV to answer a KNOCK at the
door.  Eric hobbles in.  Neff notes Eric's weatherbeaten
condition.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You don't mind me saying, Mr.
			Desmond, you look like hell.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Have you heard anything from the
			girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Not a damn thing.  What's going

			steamed up, looking for you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett
			with me --
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Back at my place... he, uh, broke
			his leg.

<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			If Corbett's men find out --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			-- I'm putting him on the plane
			to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Jiminy Christmas.
			(beat)
			What do you want from me?
<b>

</b><b>147  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					NEFF

After Eric goes, Neff closes his door and bolts it.

<b>148  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT
</b>
The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from
the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of
last week seem ages ago.

Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down
for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men
tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches;
bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the
general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from
the others.

<b>149  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling
struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a
roof leak with pitch.  Neff is sullen from his conversation
with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Why the smirk?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Bet I could make some money
			turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe
			more for lettin' him loose.
			(off Neff's flustered look)
			I was up in my cache.  Saw the
			Northland man come talk to you.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You're out of your greedy goddamn
			mind.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Corbett coming here stinks of
			trouble.  We should make the best
			of it before it turns around and
			bites us in the ass.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Stay out of it.



<b>150  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

Eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove.  Corbett watches
from the cot in the cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Talk to that good-looking girl of
			yours?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You broke the radio, remember?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(smiles)
			I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like
			a clever kid.

Corbett sits up as Eric hands him a plate of beans.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			You were real resourceful out
			there.  Got me thinking of this
			perimeter man, froze all his
			fingers one winter.  So he hacked
			the tips off and sharpened the
			exposed bones.  Gets along better
			than ever.  Yeah, maybe I
			underestimated you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I liked you better frozen.  You
			didn't talk so much.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You're damn lucky, glimpsing this
			country before it's ruined, gone
			for good.  You saw wonders you'd
			only dreamed of.  That alone
			makes you different than the
			sorry bastards back where you
			came from, because you have
			dreamt them.

Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing)
			Remember that demon in the gut?
			Sometimes it's nothing more than
			wondering if the so-called
			civilized life has bred the balls
			and brains out of you.  That's
			what you want out of this, isn't
			it?
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>150  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			All I want want is you in jail --

A KNOCK at the door interrupts.  Eric lowers the flame on
the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the
cardboard in the front window.  Frowning, he cracks the door
open and slips outside.

<b>151  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's Neff and Kenai.  Neff looks guiltily at Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			(explaining)
			He saw you and Corbett come in...
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Dixie's waiting at the infirmary.
			She'll put a splint on that
			injured leg.

Eric is skeptical of Kenai's concern.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Don't let him fool you.  Real
			reason he's here is to buy
			Corbett's traps.

Eric looks at Kenai, then at Neff.  Neff nods that it's
okay.  As extra precaution, Eric handcuffs Corbett's right
wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(to Kenai)
			Okay.  You can talk to him.  But
			I'll keep the keys with me.

<b>152  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
</b>
Outside the wind HOWLS.  Eric enters and walks into the
hallway connecting the bath partitions.  A hand grabs his
arm.  Startled, he turns around.

It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.
<b>					
</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			Earl says you get discount.
			Twenty-five dollar.

Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai.  He gives her three
tens.  She smiles and leads Eric toward the "infirmary."
It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining
table and a first-aid kit.



<b>153  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>

Neff paces nervously.  Corbett smiles at him and Kenai.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			(apologetically)
			Look, Ben, we don't want any
			trouble.  The kid's got the key,
			and besides, he looks edgy enough
			to use that magnum he's carrying.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Relax.  I'll get loose in time.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Any traps you don't want, I'll
			pay cash money.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Guess someone should use them.
			Open the bottom drawer in
			Wilder's desk.  My kit's in
			there.  Might as well unload
			everything.

Kenai tugs on the drawer.  It's locked.  Undaunted, he
jimmies it open with a knife.  Neff groans.  Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.  He checks
for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.  Satisfied, he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars.

With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings:
clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books.
He looks up and shrugs.

<b>154  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.  His foot rests on a stool.
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a
hot towel draped over his face.  Above him, on a wall
bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.

The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.  She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now
wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.  Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.
<b>					
</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			I wash your back for you.  You

Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again.  It's
Meyerling.  He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and
she scurries away.

Consisting of a handful of sod-roof cabins, mostly bars,
Chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest,
sixty miles southeast of Devil's Cauldron.

<b>156  INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone
WHORE out of her parka.  He's got the motor running for
warmth.  Her gold tooth glints in the light from the
building next to them.  The locating screen on the beat-up
radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS
phosphorescent green.
<b>					
</b><b>					WHORE
</b>			They got nice beds upstairs,
			honey.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			I'm standin' guard duty.
			Besides, rather spend the room

Over the sound of LeMalle's exertions there begins an
insistent succession of BEEPS.  The Whore looks over
LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device.
<b>					
</b><b>					WHORE
</b>			Hey, Tiger --

LeMalle turns and immediately loses interest in the Whore.
Pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's HORN three
times.

			You can't see past your lousy

<b>

<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			This miserable wilderness is a

<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Some day these people'll wake up,
			and you'll be the first one
			they'll run out of here.

Eric's attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV
screen.  There are three short bursts, followed by three
long bursts.  Something about it is very familiar.
Scowling, he sits up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Shit...

			Do what you have to.  So will I.

Eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on.



<b>158  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps.   The
door bursts open and Eric hobbles in.  Gun drawn, Eric
unlocks the cell door.  He rips Corbett's shirt open.
Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the
cot.  Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag
an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.

Furious, he flings it against the wall, smashing it.

Fat, dry snowflakes pour through the still air.  Gloomy
clouds hang immediately overhead.  Visibility is ten feet;
the temperature is below zero.

<b>162  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's 5:30 AM.  Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops
from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam
cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then
seals it with masking tape.  Watching him from the cell,
Corbett smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Flashbomb, eh?

Eric doesn't answer.  He pulls on a heavy overcoat of
Wilder's.  Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk,
Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.  He puts it and some
speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.

<b>163  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE
</b>
Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall.  He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he
stands motionless in the snow.

Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse.

After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.  He
climbs up into the catwalk.

As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing.  Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway.
<b>									
</b><b>									END MONTAGE
</b>


<b>164  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric's unexpected appearance startles Kenai.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I need to rent a cabin.
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			What's the problem with Sam
			Wilder's place?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			Pretty clever:  If the trappers
			got that signal beacon and get
			here in time, Sam's is the first
			place they'll look.  They may
			figure you're waiting for an
			airplane, so you can't stay in
			the shack by the airstrip.  Last
			place they'd expect you is on the
			far side of town.
			(shakes his head)
			I can't afford any trouble --
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(takes out all his cash)
			-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And
			if you or anyone else will back
			me up on this --
<b>					
</b><b>					KENAI
</b>			(grabs money)
			-- Forget it.  And try not to
			bleed on my throw rugs.
			(walks away, then turns
				back)
			Why do this?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			If you have to ask, you wouldn't
			understand.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Outside, there is the high-pitched WHINE of a snowmobile
(OS) driving into town.  Eric cautiously follows the SOUND.

<b>165  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - CLOSE ON ERIC
</b>
He listens as the vehicle cuts across town toward Neff's
house.  The snowfall is too thick to see who it is.  Eric
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>165  CONTINUED:
</b>
moves in as close as he dares.  The ENGINE stops (OS) and
FOOTSTEPS crunch up Neff's driveway.

<b>WIDER ANGLE - NEFF'S HOUSE
</b>
A person in a hooded parka stands on Neff's stoop, about to
knock.  Magnum drawn, Eric suddenly appears from the curtain
of falling snow.  He shoves the person against the side of
the house.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
It's Anne Marie.  She gasps.  Seeing Eric, she's more angry
than relieved.  Eric puts the gun back in his waistband.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Eric!  Why aren't you in
			Fairbanks?

He pulls her away from Neff's doorstep.  Her anger
dissolving, she wraps her arms around him.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four
			days!  I thought you were dead,
			or worse.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You can't stay here.  Go back to
			the Turtle.  I'll meet you back
			there in a few hours.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(stung by his coolness)
			What's going on?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'll tell you everything later.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Where's Corbett?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Here.  A transport plane is due
			at eleven.  Once I put him on it,
			it's all over.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			So what's the problem?
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>165  CONTINUED:  (2)
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			There isn't one, unless Corbett's
			men get here before the plane
			does.

Anne Marie grasps the situation with a sickening clarity.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Let the people here handle it.
			It's their marshal Corbett
			killed!

<b>CUTAWAY - NEFF
</b>
has been eavesdropping on the conversation through his
window.  The news about Wilder stuns him.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Please, Anne Marie, you being
			here only complicates things.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			I'm staying.

Eric knows she won't relent.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Take the snowmobile, park it
			behind Wilder's cabin.

Sighing, she STARTS the snow machine.  Most of her photo
gear is lashed to the saddlebags.  As she pulls away, Eric
limps back to Neff's house and knocks on the door.
<b>			INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE
</b>
Shaken, Neff opens the door and lets Eric in.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I was just on my way to your
			ladyfriend's, but I guess she
			found you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last
			night.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I'm the one should be sorry...
			Goddamn Kenai, always out for a
			score.  I never should've let him
			go over there.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>165  CONTINUED:  (3)
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I'd sure like that favor you
			offered a while back.

Neff gets a seasick look on his face.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count
			on it turning this ugly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			What are you talking about?
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			Bastards killed Sam, you think
			they won't kill the rest of us?
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			There'll be three, four men at
			the most.  I have some backup,
			nothing will happen.
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			I'm real sorry.  In a while,
			you're gone from this country.
			But we live here.  No one wants
			to mix it up with those hombres.

Neff opens the door for Eric.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(angry)
			You don't care enough about Sam
			to --
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			-- Sam Wilder was my cousin.
			He's why I came to Alaska.  All
			his letters, saying what a
			paradise it is.  But me ending up
			dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

<b>166  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Anne Marie waits in front as Eric hobbles up.  She looks at
his bad ankle.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			You're hurt.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have
			to hurry.

He leads her inside.



<b>167  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
Corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Could've told you no one would
			help...

Seeing Anne Marie, he smiles.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; to Anne Marie)
			Maybe you can talk sense into
			your boyfriend.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Shut up!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Anne Marie)

			Either way, you better clear out.
			I don't want anyone innocent
			getting harmed.

This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.  Angry,
Eric throws Corbett a coat.  Corbett puts it on.  Reaching
through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We're moving.  Let's go.

As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver.

<b>168  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a
beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove.  Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream.

Eric checks his watch.  6:15 AM.  He bolts the door and
blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from
outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You'll catch a chill by that dumb
			waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.
			(hands her the .44)
			Keep this pointed at him if I get
			preoccupied.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>168  CONTINUED:
</b>
Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun.  Trying to allay
her fears, Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face.
Corbett intently watches them.  Before he can say anything,
Eric shoots him a cold look.  Corbett stays quiet.

<b>169  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
</b>
A pall hangs over the town.  People know to stay inside.
Time crawls by.

In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.  He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside.

In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.  All the stalls are
empty.

In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow.  Dixie comes up behind him and puts her
hands on his shoulders.  He looks up at her, glum.

In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return.

In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.  10:45 AM.

<b>170  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR WILDER'S CABIN - DAY
</b>
The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases.
The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into
town.  It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a
woodpile across from Wilder's cabin.

The trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's
Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob
carries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.  It's so
cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it
hits the ground.

They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.

<b>ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS
</b>
The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move
closer.  There is no sign of life.  Viking Bob gestures for
the others, now positioned on either side of the cabin, to
crouch down for cover.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(calls out)
			Ben?  Ben Corbett?

No response.  Carbine held at his hip, Viking Bob walks up
to the door and, with a mighty kick, BREAKS it in.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>170  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH WILDER'S CABIN DOOR
</b>
Viking Bob points the carbine at an empty room.  He notices,
however, Corbett's duffel bag on the floor of the cell.

<b>171  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON
</b>
The trappers march through town like an advancing army,
looking for some sign of Corbett.  LeMalle stops to dig
through his pockets for some food.  All he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar.  Viking Bob looks at him
impatiently.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Look, we pull Ben's ass out of
			the fire, I'll get you a whole
			damn crate of Snickers bars.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(insulted)
			I'm right fuckin' here with you.

To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling,
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door.  This proves fruitless, so he lets out a
frustrated YELL.  Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets
off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the
foothills.

<b>172  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor.
Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall.  After a moment of
silence, from outside, not too far away:
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE (OS)
</b>			Ben!  Speak out before I torch
			every dump in town!

Eric points the magnum at Corbett.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Answer and I'll shoot!
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You kill me, you sign your death
			warrant.
			(re Anne Marie)
			And hers.



<b>173  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Viking Bob and Mitchell come running over to LeMalle.
LeMalle fires another couple SHOTS for emphasis.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(calls out)
			You hear me?  Ben?
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(to LeMalle)
			Ease off.  We do this my way.

He and the others strain their ears for a clue.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			(continuing; calls out)
			Whoever's holding Ben Corbett,
			listen to me: we just want to
			know he's okay.  He is, nobody
			gets hurt.

<b>174  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
His mind racing, Eric stares at Corbett.  Despite the
freezing temperature of the room, he's sweating.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			They know I'm here.  I don't say
			something, they'll plow this town
			under.  You willing to accept
			that responsibility?

Setting his resolve, Eric drags Corbett to the window.  He
pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbett's cheek.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll
			kill you if they rush us.

Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave
front.  Despite the gun in his face, Corbett remains calm.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(shouts through window)
			Bob?

<b>175  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Hearing Corbett's voice, the trappers spin around, trying to
ascertain its direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT (OS)
</b>			Relax.  I got a nervous man here
			with a magnum up my nose.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>175  CONTINUED:
</b>
The trappers follow his VOICE toward the rental cabins.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			You in one piece?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT (OS)
</b>			I'm fine.  Look forward to seeing
			you...
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Count on it.

<b>176  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric pulls Corbett away from the window.  He shoots a look
at Anne Marie.  They're in a bind and she knows it.

<b>177  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
LeMalle grabs Viking Bob's arm.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(to Viking Bob)
			Sweet-talk won't get shit.
			(calls out)
			Choose it, asswipe -- cut Corbett
			loose, or soon as you come
			outside, I put a fuckin' bullet
			through your eye!

<b>178  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric glances at Corbett, whose grim look certifies LeMalle's
boast.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Snow's to their advantage, kid.
			You can't see them, but soon as
			that plane comes, they'll sure as
			hell know where we're going.
			Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon.
			I'll give you that money and
			guarantee you'll walk away.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Why offer a buyoff with your
			gunmen waiting outside?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			The time has passed for men like

			That's why they'll kill you.

</b><b>178  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b>					CORBETT (Cont'd)

			Be rude to let that happen after

Anne Marie tries to hide how tempted she is by Corbett's
offer.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(to Eric)
			He's right about the snow.  We're
			blind.

Eric sighs -- is she against him, too?  From outside:
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB (OS)
</b>			Ben?

The trappers are obviously much closer.  Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Eric and Corbett face the window.  They don't notice as Anne
Marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb
waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin.  Eric turns,
gasping as he realizes she's gone.  Corbett smiles
sardonically.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			At least your girl had the sense
			to jump ship.  Too bad she's the
			only one small enough to fit
			through that dumb waiter.

<b>179  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
</b>
Using the cover of the snowfall, Anne Marie circles around
the outside edge of town toward Wilder's cabin.  She takes
some of her photo gear from the snowmobile.

<b>180  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
Unaware of Anne Marie's maneuver, the trappers wait for a
response from Corbett.  None comes.  Viking Bob places a
calming hand on LeMalle's shoulder.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			Just wait, we don't know what
			this guy's up to.  Ben'll let us
			know what to do.



<b>181  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - ANTENNA TOWER
</b>
With a camera bag slung over her shoulder, Anne Marie climbs
up the metal antenna tower behind Neff's house on the edge
of town. She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of
vertigo. The ground disappears from sight, hidden by the
snow and fog.

Fifty feet up, she attaches her infrared video camera to the
tower crossbars and, using a length of coaxial cable, hooks
its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna.

<b>182  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric looks at his watch.  10:55 AM.

<b>183  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
A CRACKING twig behind the cabins gets the trappers'
attention.  Clutching his rifle, LeMalle goes to
investigate.

<b>WITH LEMALLE
</b>
as he probes through the snow, listening.  He reaches the
edge of the woods and, finding nothing, returns to the
others.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Anne Marie crouches behind a tree, twenty feet behind
LeMalle.  After a moment, she tiptoes back toward the rental
cabin.

<b>184  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft.  Anne Marie wriggles back
inside.  Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers
over his mouth.  She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.  It's Devil's Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.  The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene.  Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes.
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. --
are pink and red.  And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi.  The trappers.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Corbett is amazed.  Eric smiles at Anne Marie.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>184  CONTINUED:
</b><b>

			Technology in the wilderness.
			Only problem is talking to you on
			your way to the landing strip.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			I've got an idea.  We'll have to
			work fast.

He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies,
then stops and looks up.  Outside, there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD.  The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance.

<b>185  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
</b>
The trappers look at each other as the SOUND of the plane
grows louder.
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB
</b>			There's what they're waiting on!
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(smiles tightly)
			They'll have to come right past
			us.

<b>186  EXT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Eric quietly pulls the door open.  Holding the pistol to
Corbett's head, he pushes Corbett out in front of him.

Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look.  Fighting back
tears, she reaches up and touches his face.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			When you ran off, I thought you'd
			keep going 'til you were back
			home in Washington.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			My home is here.  With you.

He smiles.  Then he and Corbett are gone, lost from sight in
the snowfall.   After a beat, Anne Marie takes a deep breath
and slinks away in the other direction, toward the dance
hall.
<b>

</b><b>186  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>ANGLE NEAR THE MAQI
</b>
The trappers wait, twenty-five feet from Eric and Corbett.
The DRONE of the plane grows louder.

<b>ERIC AND CORBETT
</b>
start toward the airstrip.  Corbett sees a patch of bare
dirt and SCUFFS his feet in it.

<b>ANGLE NEAR MAQI
</b>
The trappers turn to the SOUND, heard under the RUMBLE of
the still-distant plane.  Converging, they head in that
direction.  Suddenly, Anne Marie's VOICE booms through the
town:
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE (OS)
</b>			(over PA)
			They're moving toward you!

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric SHOOTS a couple times, then backtracks and pulls
Corbett behind one of the rental cabins.

Ducking the bullets, the trappers sprawl onto the ground.

<b>187  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Anne Marie has turned on the rusty TV near the pulpit.
While watching the infrared IMAGE of the action outside, she
holds the microphone wired to the old PA.

<b>ANGLE - THE TRAPPERS

Viking Bob gestures to Mitchell and LeMalle to separate.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE (OS)
</b>			(over PA)
			They're fanning out.

Angry, LeMalle BLASTS his rifle in direction of her VOICE.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE

			Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck
			she seein' us?
<b>					
</b><b>					VIKING BOB

Stalking, anxious, LeMalle follows Viking Bob.

</b>

<b>MITCHELL
</b>
splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow.

<b>188  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two
buildings in the center of town.  He walks in Corbett's
footprints.  Almost through to the other side, he suddenly
stops.  Pulling Corbett with him, Eric walks backwards,
still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT.
Corbett can't help but smile.

<b>189  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Watching the TV screen, Anne Marie sees one of the red blips
change direction and head toward her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(into mic)
			One is moving back toward the

<b>190  EXT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
It's LeMalle.  He crosses to Kenai's generator.  With a
well-placed rifle SHOT to its innards, he GRINDS it to a
halt.

<b>191  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.  Anne Marie
keys the PA microphone; it's dead, too.

<b>192  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings.  Eric
backtracks toward the hot springs spa, now leaving an
obvious trail.

<b>193  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric and Corbett go inside.  Eric pulls the door closed
behind them, but leaves it ajar.

<b>194  INT.  KENAI'S HOUSE
</b>
The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder.  Kenai
stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters.  Dixie looks
at him.
<b>					
</b><b>					DIXIE
</b>			Earl, it's crazy to go out there.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>194  CONTINUED:
</b><b>

He straps on a holster under his sealskin coat.

<b>195  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP - LONG SHOT
</b>
The big 4-prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snow-covered airstrip.

<b>196  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside.

<b>197  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar.
He peers inside.

<b>198  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention.

He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.
He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for
balance.

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a
yelp, he splashes into the water below.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(to Corbett)
			That'll keep him out of the cold.

<b>LEMALLE
</b>
climbs out of the central pool, soaked.   He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down.



<b>199  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa.  A GUNSHOT
rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's
head.

<b>MITCHELL
</b>
has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow.  He
purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.

<b>ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back.   They are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall.

<b>200  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings.  He continues to a point where they converge to
one set, then stop.  He smiles at the naivete of Eric's
ploy.  Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes
Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
boardwalk.  Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues
along the alley.

SNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
back in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle.

<b>201  EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES
carry though the town.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			He'll live.

<b>202  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes
to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob
tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is
broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In
agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding.

<b>203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.
Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped

in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them.  His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.
Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.
He comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
.44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(gasping)
			Don't make me shoot.

She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.
LeMalle glowers menacingly.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			(continuing)
			We're going to Sam's cabin.  You
			can stay in the jail until this
			is over.

LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie
wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Want to chance it with that
			hog-leg?  You can't even hold it
			up.  Better drop me first shot,
			bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'
			lungs out.

Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is
paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the Remington.

Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle
close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne
Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,
leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets
her arm fall.

<b>204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN

Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the
worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot.

Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's

</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			I'll handle him.

<b>206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot.

As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>206  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION
</b>
Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming
right for them.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses
it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.

Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash
has temporarily clouded his vision.

Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for Mitchell to move on.

<b>207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still
having trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			(whispers)
			Over there...

He hoists his Remington.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			(whispers)
			Hold it.  You might hit Ben.
<b>					
</b><b>					LEMALLE
</b>			Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming
			at.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Let 'em come closer first...

But LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up,
left-handed, and SHOOTS.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns
FIRE with the .357.

<b>208  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>208  CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT
</b>
as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,
nearby.  Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the
depot.  There is no further movement.

Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward
the depot.

<b>209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over
something.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the
wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.
Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls
him closer.
<b>					
</b><b>					MITCHELL
</b>			Glad to see you're okay.  I told
			LeMalle not to shoot.
			(tries to smile)
			Had some fine seasons, didn't
			we...

Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.
Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's
pocket, Corbett picks it up.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Eric)
			Fifteen years on the trail with
			this man, I never saw him rise to
			anger.

Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood,
and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Eric
pulls back.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; bitterly)
			Your first kill.  How does it
			taste?

Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric
stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett
inside.



<b>210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
</b>
The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
removes his Walkman headphones.  Hearing LeMalle's
continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his two-way radio.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			(into radio mic)
			Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just
			touched down in Devil's Cauldron.
			Nobody's here to greet me like
			usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm
			getting scarce.

With that, he STARTS his engines up again.

<b>CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT
</b>
who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
life OS.

<b>211  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
</b>
The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off.  He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly
opens.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			You can't leave yet.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			It's my responsibility to get
			this aircraft out of here safely.

Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
<b>					
</b><b>					PILOT
</b>			(continuing)
			You got to be kidding.
<b>					
</b><b>					ANNE MARIE
</b>			Leave the engines idling.  Go
			back and open the side door.


Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
and obliges the little lady with the big gun.



<b>212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about.

Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane.

Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goes
for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
forward.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Nobody wants any more killings;
			we all agree to that, correct?
			(no one argues)
			That's good.  Now, Eric, you're
			gonna hand your prisoner over to
			us.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Fuck you.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			This isn't your concern.  It's
			over, here and now.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(to Meyerling)
			Sure, when you put a bullet in my
			back on the way out.  Easier for
			all involved.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben.
			There's no room in Alaska for you
			any more.

Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-
and bear-spears.
<b>					
</b><b>					MEYERLING
</b>			(continuing)
			You're as antiquated as this
			shit.

Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>212  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Keep back.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			You're quite a piece of work,
			Meyerling.  The tide changes, you
			ride right along with it.

Eric looks at Neff.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Neff, you know better than
			this...
<b>					
</b><b>					NEFF
</b>			You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.
			Step aside; stay out of it.

Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.  Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed in
blood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
dead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
massive Remington.

He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing
himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.

Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.

Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands, and hurls it.

There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.

LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest.

Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
the muzzle blast.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
There is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,
Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do
anything, Meyerling FIRES.

The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>212  CONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp.  Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
and Neff pull them apart.  Eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Anybody moves and I'll shoot!

Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.  Bleeding
from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			(continuing)
			Can you walk?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			Wound's a through-and-through.
			Missed my liver, I think.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			Let's get out of here.

Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett
get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.

<b>213  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP
</b>
Anne Marie jumps down from the cockpit.  She and Eric lift
Corbett into the plane.

<b>214  EXT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
as it taxis and lifts off.

<b>215  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
While Eric takes Corbett's handcuffs off, Anne Marie looks
at his wound.  He waves her away.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			How come you didn't let him shoot
			me?
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(softly)
			Like I said, I'd still be up on
			that mountain, frozen solid, it
			wasn't for you.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			We'll get you to a hospital, soon
			as we get to Fairbanks.
<b>								
</b><b>								(CONTINUED)
</b><b>215  CONTINUED:
</b><b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			So they can patch me up and put
			me in a cage?  Forget it.
			Meyerling's right -- I'm a
			dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like
			him, it's their turn with this
			land.  Put me in the woods, let
			me live or die on my own.

He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.
<b>					
</b><b>					CORBETT
</b>			(continuing; peers out
				window)
			Look down there, tell me what any
			of this matters.  Struggles of
			men get swallowed by the bigness.
			Soon there won't be a trace of
			our troubles... or us.
<b>					
</b><b>					ERIC
</b>			You're wrong.  Everything we do
			leaves its mark.  You said it
			yourself -- there are hundred-
			year-old footprints in the
			tundra.

Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.
He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it.

<b>EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAW
</b>
The exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a
grizzly beside a wilderness creek, with trees and mountains
in the background.

<b>CORBETT
</b>
clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes.

<b>NEW ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood --
on the back of his hand.  He stares at Corbett for a long
moment.  Then, resolved, he climbs up front and says
something to the Pilot.  Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts his
controls.

The snow clouds are dissipating.  The cargo plane comes down
through them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumping
station.

<b>217  INT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
As it rolls to a stop, Eric throws open the cargo door.
Corbett sits up, surprised.  He and Eric exchange a long
look, then Corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly
steps down onto the snow-covered runway.

<b>218  EXT.  CARGO PLANE
</b>
Eric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane as
Corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline.  As he
goes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.

Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continues
onward, disappearing into the forest.

<b>ANGLE ON CARGO PLANE
</b>
Eric closes the cargo door as the Pilot turns the plane
around and taxis back down the runway.

<b>219  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)

Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.  She kisses him.

The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.

			Too damn crazy in this state

<b>220  INT.  CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)

The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,
ice blue sky.  It banks and turns south.  Behind it, the
mountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.

Golden Okay guys, one of the worst days in N.A..S.A history just 
got worse.  Ten million to one. A rogue comet came from deep 
space and collided with an  asteroid. Some  kids actually got a 
picture of the collision event and told no one.  The stuff that 
hit this morning was the collision's forward-thrown matter, mere  
pebbles from what's  about to come. Walter? 

Clark A big asteroid. E.T.A., eighteen days. A lot bigger than 
the five mile  one that obliterated the dinosaurs.

Temple sits with the Joint Chiefs, White House Chief of Staff, 
the Directors of  the N.A.S.A., C.I.A., etc.

Temple Dan, we're all here. Tell us what we're up against. 

Golden 
<b>(V.O.)
</b> In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one  
mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force 
of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand. Half 
our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and 
heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the  end, it 
will be men  eating the flesh of other men. 
(beat)
 It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - 
will still be here. But there will be no  life - maybe 
cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria. 

Temple Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got 
off the phone  with the Russians. They're just about to launch a 
new Mars Probe on the biggest  rocket in the world.  Golden and 
the N.A.S.A. BRASS exchange sceptical looks.

Golden 
<b>(V.O)
</b> With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in  
'96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa. 

Temple They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with 
four Atlas  Class IV nuclear warheads. Enough punch in their 
opinion - not to break it up -  but to slow it down enough to 
miss Earth's orbit. 

Golden 
<b>(V.O)
</b> Their launch date is set for next month.

Temple They're going to move it up.

Golden 
<b>(V.O)
</b> To when?

Temple Sixteen hours from now.

All the N.A.S.A. Technicians CLAMOR at once.

Golden 
<b>(V.O)
</b> What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together?  
Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear 
detonation is not  going to work.  The only way is to split the 
thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us. 

Temple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.

Colinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr. President?

President 
<b>(V.O)
</b> Well, this has been a tough day. The media's all over this.  
They're going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be 
dead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic. 

Golden 
<b>(V.O)
</b> Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing  
to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only 
twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now. You've 
got a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but 
impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth,  
you'll never keep a lid on  this. No way.

Golden How many of you are as scared as I am?

Golden raises his hand. All the other N.A.S.A. Techs, one by one, 
raise their  hands.

Golden One giant leap for Mankind. Everyone remember that? This 
is what we are  going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid 
with a nuclear device, implant  it and get off  before it blows. 
Quincy? 

All eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&amp;D, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has 
coke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q.

Quincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a 
third degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious 
damage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault 
lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. 

Golden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not.

Skip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.

Golden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national 
security and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there 
arnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current

self-contained city. 

HARRY STAMPER, world's foremost expert on offshore deep drilling,

Grace I just talked with A.J.

Harry Talking to him quite a bit these days....

Grace 
(awkward pause)
 "A" rig's acting up. The drill string kicked twice this  
morning, gave Chick a nasty bruise in the head.

Harry Good. He's not vulnerable there.

London refuses to underwrite the  Venezuela&gt; Project....  

Harry Thieves and cowards, all of 'em. Twist their arms.

Harry Keep twisting. Like a pit bull.

Grace Oh, and that magazine article - they want some human

Fishing, Single Malt Scotch, Old  Movies. What about  "Dislikes?"

Harry Any kind of flying and oil company executives. Go deal with 
'em. I  always look better when you're doing the talking.

Harry HITS another ball. CLANG.

Grace You know you donate 300 grand a year to Greenpeace.

Harry smiles at the contradiction.

Harry What'd your mother call me?

A.J. In love, I mean. Fallen in love. It's the damnedest thing, 
but this  person you...know...really well.

ACROSS THE PLATFORM - Grace escorts five angry OIL INDUSTRY 
EXECUTIVES over to  Harry. A KLAXON SOUNDS. Harry, alarmed, 
rushes right past them, toward the "A"  Derrick. They follow, 
snapping at his heels

Oil Executive 1 You explicitly promised results at 25 thousand 
feet.

Harry We have results.

Oil Executive 2 But we don't have oil. We've given you everything 
you've  asked....

Harry Horseshit. What the...? Chick! Bennie! Somebody better tell 
me why the  hell "A" derrick is not turning!

Chick hurries up to Harry.

Chick The uhh....the Greenpeace guys.

Harry approaches "A" Derrick. Five MEMBERS of Greenpeace have 
handcuffed  themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe.

Harry Hey there, what can I do for you?

Greenpeace Leader This is an official protest.

Harry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and 
whales, I like 'em  too. Hey, I know you. You too. Didn't you 
have shorter hair?

Greenpeace Leader Stamper, do you know what this thing does to 
the eco-system?

Harry How'd you get out here? Canoe? Rowboat? Oh, that boat down 
there with a  thousand horsepower diesel!

Greenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at 
yourself in the  mirror?

Harry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this 
morning. And you  used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know 
most electricity's from burning oil?  I'' stop drillin' when the 
world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up! 

Greenpeace Leader Wait........

Harry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave 
me 57 mil. to  find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause 
they have no lives! 

The drill string begins to turn in the hole.

Greenpeace Leader We....we threw away the key.

Harry Sorry. Time is money. BENNIE!

The MASSIVE HYDRAULIC KELLY begins to descend on the Greenpeace 
Activists'  heads.

Greenpeace Leader STOP!!!!

Harry Bennie! Third gear!

The Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically 
begins  unlocking the handcuffs.

Grace turns to the oil executives.

Grace He's good at public relations.

A.J. We gotta clear the Derrick!

Harry

 Chick, rig up another pipe. 
(Chick and Bennie look  at Harry with uncertainty)
<b> NOW, NOT TOMORROW.

CHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the 
DRILL STRING  like an INDY PIT STOP CREW.

A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any 
deeper, we'll  blow the rig.

Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed!

A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the 
pipe apart!

Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty 
years, kid. Get  on the controls.

A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to 
A.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL 
SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, 
then....

The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. 
The drill  spins freely.

A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry.

The roughnecks converge around the wellhead.

A.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band 
coupling.

Chick hand the items to A.J.

A.J. descends into the drilling hole.

takes a huge breath  and disappears into the brine-filled 
drilling hole.

A.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected 
pipes. Harry  comes down the hole. He plants his back against the 
hole wall and kicks the  pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE 
emanates from below. The Briny water  inside the hole suddenly 
turns BLACK and VISCOUS. 

A.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull 
for the surface,  up the drilling hole as --

Grace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the 
flooded drilling  hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass. 

Harry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL.

He grabs Grace and pulls her away.

Grace Where's A.J.!!!?

Harry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN!

The platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as 
<b>--
</b>
A GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J. 
out of the  hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to 
the platform floor. 

CRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to 
<b>A.J.

Grace Never do that again!

CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting, 
traumatised,  greasy oil raining on his head.

A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't 
do the  first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! 
(pulls out case; opens it)
 I  got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk 
to him, but try it on. 

She reaches for the ring. It slips from A.J.'s hand and falls 
through the grated  floor, pinging off the rig's steel pylons, 
100 feet into the sea below. 

Grace Don't worry! Tiffany's insures up to a week from purchase!

A.J. stares despondently over the railing.

Harry, black with crude oil, staggers past A.J.

 What's the problem, gentlemen?

Golden I wonder if we might speak alone?

Harry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and 
Albert Jack  Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J..

 They run my company. You  talk to me, you  talk to them. 

Golden Okay.

<b>INT. N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Golden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room 
viewing a  VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector, 
supplying narration. On the tape  we see Harry on a rig platform 
shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN -- 

Harry Great, home movies.

Grace and A.J. smile.

Quincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 
thousand feet.  They said it couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

ON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an 
INDONESIAN  BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The 
Businessmen shake their  heads, awed. 

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of  
anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

Harry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of 
celebrity.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand.  
Once again they said --

Golden Move it along, Quincy.

Quincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost 
expert in  deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high 
speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can I call you 
Harry? 

Harry Stick with Stamper.

Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in 
a difficult  place.

Harry I've drilled in them all.

Golden Not...this place. This is really out there. 
(beat)
 Space, Mister  Stamper.

Harry As in...outer?

SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen --

Temple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about 
the meteor  shower? 
(Harry nods)
 What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision  
course with  Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be 
over. 

Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a 
nuclear device in  it's core. To do that we need to drill an 
eight hundred foot hole. 

Harry looks at A.J. and Grace.

Harry A.J., is this guy shitting me?

A.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry --

Harry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space.

Golden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, 
any help you  can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of 
course.  

Harry Show me your rig.

<b>INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY
</b>
Quincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through 
N.A.S.A.'s Research  and Development area. This place looks like 
"Q's" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every 
company on the fortune 500 -- 

Huge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. 
TECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of 
equipment. 

TECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on 
the moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked 
passenger compartment. 

Quincy The "Armadillo" - our fourth generation rover. It carries 
a six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint 
venture with the Germans. 
(winks)
  It's designed by Porsche. 

Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM 
on a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is 
connected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. 

Harry Where's the Kelly?

Quincy This baby works without one.

Harry How does it work?

Harry starts to inspect the bit.

Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed 
differential gears.

Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further --

Harry This is my Patent.

Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics," 
by Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent 
Office last year. 

Harry You stole it.

Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper.

Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The 
drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to 
rapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of 
his design.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest  
discovery in space in thirty years.

Harry What'd this cost?

Golden Ten million.

Quincy Twenty-our million.

Harry Boy, I'm in the wrong line of work. So, that's where my 
taxes go. For  thievin' incompetent, government employed rip-off 
artists?

A.J. No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve....a big 
hunk of junk.

Quincy We're working on that.

Harry What happens if you hit gas? You have three seconds. Drill 
faster, run  like hell, or pray. 
(beat)
 Time's up. You're dead., The rig just blew. 

Golden Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the 
matter....

Harry Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.

Golden Or three....

Harry I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day 
offshore  drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling 
holes is about instinct -  about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is 
an art. You want the crux of the matter?
(beat)
 You stole my  patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to 
use it. As for this piece o'  crap, don't insult me. 
(walks around the rig)
 I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the  hole for you. 

Grace Uhm, pop, could we discuss this...?

Harry Just give me a space suit.

Golden You won't need one. You're not going up.

Harry You don't have a choice. I think all you PH.D's know that.

Harry walks off. Grace and A.J. follow.

Golden 
(calling after Harry)
 Harry. Let's figure this out.

<b>INT. N.A.S.A. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
Harry sits opposite Golden and Temple. Grace and A.J. stand 
behind him.

Harry First of all, you're going to buy my patent.

Temple Of course, completely in order. What is the price?

Harry Fifty million dollars.

Uncomfortable pause. Temple clears his throat.

Temple Mr. Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of....

Harry You're right, too low. I'm still pissed. Seventy million.

Temple Done.

Harry looks to Grace.

Harry Give that money to my Greenpeace buddies. 
(smile)
 Told  you...complicated.

Harry goes to shake, pulls back --

Harry 
(cont'd)
 And I never want to pay taxes again.

Temple I'll call the I.R.S., try to uhm, explain the situation.

They begin to shake. Harry withdraws his hand.

Harry I have this great log cabin in Montana. It's kind of a  
nature...getaway...thing.

Temple You want us to buy that, too?

Harry No. I fly fish there. But the fly fishin's sucked ever 
since they put in  that goddamn hydro-electric dam. I want it 
gone by the time I get back. 

Temple reluctantly nods. They stand to shake, Harry pulls away 
again.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Now about my crew.

Golden The deal was for you, not others.

Harry I'm only as good as the men I work with. The ones in those 
home movies  of yours.

Golden It's out of the question.

Harry half-smiles to Grace.

Golden 
(cont'd)
 Okay, who?

Harry :My chief tool pusher. You game A.J.? A.J. Wouldn't miss 
it, Harry.

Harry And my roughnecks, Roustabouts, and Rockhound?

Temple Rock what? Is that a dog?

Harry No. Just a meek, geek geophysicist.

Golden What kind of men are these?

Chick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion 
with Max.

Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have 
enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his 
"Smokey and the Bandit" period. 

Max I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt 
Reynolds of  "Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass.  

Chick Burt was trouble in that flick.

Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, 
kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is?

Chick All time? Well, let me think. "Dirty Dozen," the first 
"Death Wish." No,  no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I 
don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like 
three words during the whole picture. That's my  selection. 

Max Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think 
that buffalo  Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve 
McQueen form "Bullitt?" 

Chick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle 
this right  now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the 
Supreme Court. What's the final  verdict? 

Rockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello. 
Eric  Estrada. You know, "Chips."

Chick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then --

a BRIGHT FLASH in the sky. Night  becomes day for two seconds. 

The world slows down, motion creeps. The bright FLASH catches the

night. 

The Roughnecks look around. They know there were wrong.

Chick I gotta tell you...I'm scared.

Harry Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we 
fail, they  say the Earth will die.

Harry sits down, looks out the window at N.A.S.A. Techs working 
in the room down  below.

Harry You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut 
pussies, that's  it. They can out think you, they can outrun you. 
This job, gentlemen, is as real  as it gets. I need every one of

 If you're not up to it,  then walkout of that door. 

Finally. Theo and Pearl, frustrated, go to the TWO-WAY MIRROR, 
blocking Jimbo  from view.

Theo I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat?

Pearl I have p.m.s.!! I need some ibuprofen!

Jimbo grabs Randy's legal pad and writes:

Quincy We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a

TWO X-71 SHUTTLES in the hanger. TECHNICIANS scramble around,

Harry 
(points)
 From all of your intel, the deepest fault line is here. This is  
my sweet spot. If I can get a clean hole in there, She'll blow in 
half.... 

Golden ....and the two pieces will slide right past us. You 
cannot shatter it.  Getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as 
bad as one big one. You have to  drill, plant the nuke,  lift 
off, and detonate -- all before the asteroid reaches this  
position. 
(demonstrates position)
 You have eight hours. Remember it. You must  detonate by this 
point or,  the two halves will hit us. 

Harry nods and walks off.

Sharp Drill an eight-hundred foot hole in eight hours? Is that 
possible?

Harry doesn't like to be questioned --

Harry You just worry about getting me on that rock, Colonel. Let 
me worry  about the drilling.

A moment of conflict between them.

Harry and A.J. sit dripping in the watertight cab. Through the 
front window WE  SEE the other Roughnecks in the tank. Harry 
unlocks his neck seals. Pulls off  his helmet. 

Harry Lose the helmet, A.J.

A.J. snaps out of it. His hands go instinctively to the helmet 
and in one  motion...CLICK. It's off.

A.J. I'll follow it.

Harry I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving 
people wrong.

Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas. I scraped  
together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I 
set up a rig  and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and 
watched her soak up the sun for six  months - waiting for this 
baby to pop. Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't  listen. My 
wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody 
in town thought I  was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the 
last hour of the last day, she  popped. She spit out that black 
gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. 
(reflective )
 I  captured the magic 
(holding medal)
 This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day. 

Harry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table. He grabs a 
cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves. He hands 
one half to A.J. 

Harry

is up there?

 When we come through  this, I'll take  comfort in the fact that 
I won't ever have to answer those  questions again. You are our

have patted  you on the back more....

Grace Dad, you don't need --

Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I 
want you to know  that.

Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said 
anything like this  before.

Grace I love you, Dad.

Harry I love you too, Gracie.

Grace 
(as they hug)
 Keep an eye on A.J. for me.

Harry climbs up the metal stairs --

A.J. and the rest of Harry's crew comes out of the building. A.J. 
moves to Grace  as she watches her father disappear into the jet. 

A.J. Excuse me. 
(Grace turns)
 You're really insanely gorgeous and I was jost  sort of 
wondering if you -- 

Grace I'm engaged. But my father hasn't given him his blessing so 
you might  still have a chance. 
(smiles, then serious)
 Promise me you won't do anything  stupid up there.

A.J. nods. They kiss passionately. Harry's crew sees this and 
applauds. Grace  blushes, embarrassed.

A.J. I love you, Grace.

Grace I love you. Come back, Okay?

Harry's crew boards LEAR JET 2. A.J. starts toward LEAR JET 1. 
Grace watches him  walk away, eyeing his suit.

But a HUGE ICE BOULDER the size of a three-story building twirls 
into  Independence's path. It hits a BOULDER which collides with 
another.

Chick, Max and Bear go into action. Max screws the Bad Boy bit 
onto the first  drilling pipe. Bear hoists the pipe up to the

it on. 

Harry plugs a TEE and GOLF BALL into the craggy surface. He

just ate one of my  diamond-tipped bits in thirty minutes. That 
has never happened to me in twenty years. 

Golden You're forty minutes in. You should be down 150 feet. How 
far are you? 

Harry Not far.

Temple Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation.

Golden A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My 
scientists have  already told you that. It must be detonated 
inside the asteroid. The alternative  is that the Earth  will be 
bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic.

A.J. gets in the Armadillo. Lev goes around back, climbs on the

thrusters. 

Lev Okey-doke. 

The Armadillo begins backing down the slope. 

<b>INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

The Armadillo's REAR TIRES CHURN FORWARD, slinging rocks and 
gravel which, in  zero-g, shoot off in a stream into space, never 
falling. Lev holds on for dear  life. 

A.J.'S Armadillo churns up the slope like a Bronco 4X4, slinging 
gravel, heading  for THE JAGGED FISSURE. It FLIES over the

expanse of jagged fissure. 

<b>EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER

feet off the  ground and still ascending...into outer space. Lev, 
his next stop being Planet  Mars, panics. He climbs the roof and 
peers inside the front windshield, POUNDING  ON THE WINDSHIELD. 

Lev Down! Not up! Up is bad! Down! 

<b>INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

</b>
<b>EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

Not quite. Only the right-front and right-rear THRUSTER NOZZLES 
fire, pushing  the right side downward, rolling the Armadillo 
over on its side. Lev, on the  bumper, clings to the rear-mounted 
<b>TOW WINCH AND CABLE ASSEMBLY. 
</b>
Suspended in zero-g, on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is 
pushed by  thrusters, tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE 
CLIFF FACE next to the  slope. All four Armadillo tires slam 
against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces  off. 

Lev, grabbing the Armadillo's TOWING CABLE, flies off the rear. 
The cable spools  out and LEV, hanging on for all he's worth, 
SLAMS against the cliff face and  descends.... 

<b>INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

A.J., lying sideways, keeps toggling the thruster START SWITCH. 
The indicator  light finally FLASHES "IN" and A.J. rams it into 
drive -- 

<b>EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - CLIFF FACE / ARMADILLO 
</b>
-- the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways 
across the  cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the 
cliff face and gradually falls,  until he's bouncing on the 
asteroid surface. 

The Armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a 
stop. 

<b>INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

A.J., shaken, takes a deep breath and gets out.

 His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. 
He will not give up.

Bear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's

nervously and reaches...THE  WRENCH falls into the turbine 
spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING  SQUEAL, the 
wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and -- 

THE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE 
FORWARD,  buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT, 
smashing into Sharp's  helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield. 
He's out cold. 

Harry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused, 
works the clutch  furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS

A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND-
HELD CUTTER and a  LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction. 
The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,  bent, buckled. Severed ends stab 
into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting  with the hand-

The hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating. 

Harry

Everyone whirls around in the sound's direction as -- 

ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR - A 100 FOOT METHANE GEYSER erupts, 
spewing a PLUME OF  HIDEOUS GREENISH GAS into space. Then another 
200 FEET HIGH! Another 500 FEET  HIGH! The ASTEROID has become 
alive. The geyser's eruptions loosen the  asteroid's surface 
material and --

A.J. is whooshed violently out of the hole.

</b>
PEBBLES AND HOT STEAM BLASTS from the drilling hole. Everyone 
recoils.... 

Harry Get back!! 

A.J. shoots out of the pipe, tethering the SAFETY LINE behind 
him, blowing into  space. The safety tether snaps and RIPS off. 
A.J. is 70 feet off the surface.  Harry dives for his ripped 
tether. Catching it, inches before A.J.'s thrown into  space. 

Harry and Bear grab A.J.'s safety tether and begin to pull him 
down. Chick  stares at something O.S., his jaw drops. 

Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us. 

CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as big as 
houses, dislodge  from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly at first, 
but with terrifyingly increasing  speed and momentum..... 

.... they start rolling. 

HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what they're 
seeing. 

On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit smaller 
surface rocks,  they take little hops, and bigger hops, until 
they are BOUNDING across the  surface. Harry lashes A.J.'s tether 
to the Armadillo. 

Harry and the guys run for their lives. 

In the midst of this -- 

-- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hole. Pitts 
gets blasted  by the geyser, which blows him across the asteroid 
floor, SLAMMING him into the  parked Armadillo. A BOULDER rolls 
at Pitts and squashes him against the  ARMADILLO , killing him. 

A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER. 

A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks down at 
the ONCOMING ICE  BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbuckle the 
tether, but he can't in time. 

The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flattening it to 
the asteroid  surface, which causes -- 

--A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J. 
scrambles with his  safety harness. 

Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dives 
inside, engages the  gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward the 
oncoming ICE BOULDER. 

A.J., terrified, continues to descend as -- 

Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just as it's 
about to roll  over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES down on the 
Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING  the steel compartment around Chick, 
and gently rolls over onto -- 

A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice boulder 
WHOMPS down and  keeps rolling. 

THE NUCLEAR DEVICE is rolling across the asteroid's surface. 
Pebbles and debris  CLANGING off the device's REMOTE 
<b>DETONATOR.....

Harry bounds toward the Armadillo. THE LARGEST, JAGGED ROCK rolls 
at the  vehicle. Harry's caught. There's no place to turn. The 
rocks rolls straight at  him. Twenty feet....10 feet....Harry 
FALLS heavily to the ground. 

Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized INDENTATION 
in the asteroid  surface.... 

The BOULDER rolls right over him. 

Finally the quake stops. The situation stabilises. Everyone gets 
to their feet.  Harry and A.J. get up. They look off at -- 

The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling away in the distance, smashing into 
other rock  formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling 
away in the distance,  smashing into other rock formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. 

Sharp, with bruises on his face, looks through his cracked

Sharp He's dead. 

Harry Put it down, Chick. 

Chick tosses down the diamond and follows Harry. Everyone checks 
themselves.  Looks at others. There's no talk, no time to lose. 
They reconvene, by the  NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's dented. The 
alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled. 

Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here. 

They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole. 
They plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the 
other. The NUKE begins to  insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp 
tries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM  from the broken 
gurney. 

Sharp

going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, 
no one moves. 

Sharp Who's first?

Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. 

Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws.

Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... 

Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and 
pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two 
men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... 

A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts 
in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J.

Harry Draw. 

A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches 
and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. 
It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his 
hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small 
smile. 

A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the

A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half 
medallion.

Watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the 
explosion grow  CLOSER....She hits the directional THRUSTERS, 
jamming it as hard as it will  go...the flames bite up at them. 
The shuttle veers off toward Earth. 

A.J. Harry.... 

A.J. and the others stare out the cockpit window as the NUCLEAR 
FISSION  EXPLOSION FLAMES OUT, the halves of the asteroid wing 
off. 

<b>EXT. AROUND THE WORLD - MONTAGE OF IMAGES 
</b>
IN EXTREME SLOW MO, we see images around the world. WALL STREET 
deserted....a  crowded BAR with people huddled around a 
T.V....Extremely tight on a TEAR  falling form a woman's 
face....ENGLISH FARMERS in a corn field.....a FATHER  holding his 
SON as they watch the brilliant flaming sky....Golden closes his  
eyes and falls to his seat....Arms raise in unison....PEOPLE 
embrace....AT THE  PYRAMIDS, dappled in firelight, hundreds 
praying.... 

<b>INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
</b>
Grace is quietly weeping. 

THE ASTEROID'S DETONATION is computer-imaged on the Central 
Board. WE SEE the  ASTEROID'S TWO HALVES, moving in new 
directions. The Technicians stare in  wonderment. 

Golden Where are they, Flip? Give me some angles, give me some 
directions,  give me speeds... 

Flip 
(analysing new data)
 The new courses are....they're gonna miss us! 

The Technicians CHEER. Grace looks up. Wipes her tears. Golden 
approaches her. 

Golden I just want to tell you I'm proud to know the daughter of 
the man who  just saved the world. 

<b>EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 
</b>
Shuttle Freedom touches down. N.A.S.A. QUARANTINE VEHICLES race 
out to meet it. 

<b>INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 
</b>
N.A.S.A.TEHNICIANS sit at consoles, exhausted. There are Coke 
cans, coffee mugs,  cigarettes overflowing ashtrays. Jimbo, Theo 
and Pearl, wearing V.I.P. VISITORS  BUTTONS, stand at the back. 

Jimbo This definitely doesn't look like a glamorous job. 

<b>INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 
</b>
A.J., Chick and Bear unbuckle, begin to rise from seats. 

Chick I'm dyin' for a Budweiser. 

Sharp Stay seated. Let the medical quarantine trucks set up. 

Bear I ain't gettin' another enema from Nurse Ratchet. 

A.J., Chick and Bear look at each other. 

A.J. What would Harry do? 

Bear I think he'd go get a beer. 

<b>EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 
</b>
The EMERGENCY HATCH DOOR BLOWS in front of surprised N.A.S.A. 
<b>QUARANTINE  TECHNICIANS. 
</b>
<b>EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 
</b>
A.J., Chick and Bear walk away from the shuttle. All he N.A.S.A. 
QUARANTINE  MEDICS are looking for them. 

Chick What are you lookin' at? 

Bear Yeah, okay, you're right, we're the studs who just blew up 
the Death  Star. 

A wave of fans are held back by MILITARY POLICE. 

Sharp, holding his shoulder in pain, is helped across the tarmac 
by Watts. A VET  BYSTANDER comes up to Sharp and drapes an 
American flag over his shoulders. 

Temple, with a huge grin, approaches Sharp. Temple salutes Sharp. 

Among the masses, Chick catches sight of Denise. Tommy stands 
next to her,  waving a small flag, proud as can be. 

Grace runs toward A.J.; he sees her and runs to her. 

They fall into each others arms. Grace is crying. A.J. is crying. 
They kiss.  A.J. looks up at the sky. 

A.J. He's up there, Grace. And he'll never die. Will you marry 
me? I gotcha a  new rock.... 

A.J. pulls out one of the DIAMONDS from the asteroid surface, as 
big as a  doorknob, about two thousand karats. It glitters in the 
sunlight. Grace stares  at it, agog. 

As we PULL BACK and CAMERA TILTS TO THE SKIES ABOVE. 

Where Harry Stamper's soul remains.....

           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

<b>          CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

<b>                         ARE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
</b>
          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

<b>                         QUIET:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

<b>          ROLLS OFF FAST --
</b>
<b>          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

<b>                          POE
</b>          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           We've got company.

<b>          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

<b>          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

<b>          IN THE DISTANCE.
</b>          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

<b>                          POE
</b>           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

<b>          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --
</b>
<b>          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
</b>          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

<b>                         HIM:
</b>
<b>                          SENIOR TROOPER
</b>           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Look how old you've become.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I'll show you the dark side.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

<b>          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

<b>          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!

          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the

          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his

          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

<b>          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

<b>          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
</b>          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

<b>          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b>
          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

<b>                          UNKAR
</b>           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

<b>          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

</b>           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           NOMA.
</b>          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

<b>          BEEPING BB-8.
</b>          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

<b>                          REY
</b>           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

<b>                          REY
</b>           What's your hurry, thief?

<b>                          FINN
</b>           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

<b>          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

           stole it!

<b>                          FINN
</b>           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

</b>           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

<b>                          (RELIVING IT)
</b>           Poe didn't make it.

</b>           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

<b>                          REY
</b>           So you're with the Resistance?

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

<b>                          (WHISPERS)
</b>           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

<b>                          REY
</b>           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

<b>                          REY
</b>           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

<b>                          STORMTROOPER

          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.

          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

<b>                          REY

</b>           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her

          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up

          LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
          Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

</b>           Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
           you.
          Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
          Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
          CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a

          NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
          A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8

           The Empire. Today, it is the First

          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
          Finn.

          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her

          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

<b>          DOOR OPENS.
</b>          Hesitant, Rey enters.

<b>          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

<b>                          YOUNG GIRL
</b>
<b>           NO!
</b>          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.

          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes

          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's

          this challenge more!
          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!

          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
          Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF

          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

</b>           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
</b>
          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
</b>
          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
</b>
          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

<b>          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
</b>
          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

<b>          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
</b>          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

</b><b>   "CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"
</b><b>   
</b>   Play over this image.
<b>   
</b>   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
<b>   
</b>   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
</b>             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
             spray gun outta South Miami.
<b>   
</b>   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
             for two hundred and sell 'em for
             eight.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
<b>   ROBBIE.
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
<b>   
</b>   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
<b>   
</b>   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
<b>   
</b>   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
<b>   
</b>   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Check out this body-builder chick...
             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell punches up the volume.
<b>   
</b>   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Thanks, Baby.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Who's your partner?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
   "Movieline Inside" magazine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
             Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
             him, gets it to my customers. On all
             my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
             have a pot to piss in or a window to
             throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
             motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
             got himself a yacht, with all kinds
             of high tech navigational shit on it.
                   (back to video)
             AK-47, the very best there is.
<b>   
</b>   GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
   camera and describes the AK-47.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             When you absolutely, positively,
             gotta kill every motherfucker in the
             room, accept no substitute. That
             there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
             fifty and double my money.
<b>   
</b>   The phone rings.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL(CONT'D)
</b>             Get that for me, will ya baby?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You know it's for you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell just stares at her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Girl, you better not make me go over
             there and put my feet to ya.
<b>   
</b>   Louis keeps staring at he screen.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
   the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
   says:
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Hello.
<b>   
</b>   Puts the phone down and says;

</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             It's for you.
<b>   
</b>   Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
   chair, reclining back all the way.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
   phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>                   (into phone)

                   (pause)
             Hey, Junebug, what's up
<b>   
</b>   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
   watching the video.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>                   (referring to the tape)

<b>   
</b>   Louis nods his head in agreement.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hangs up the phone.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
   Louis.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.

</b>   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a

   room drinking coffee.

             Where do I sign?
<b>   
</b>   Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
   of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell

             I was wondering. What if before the

             hit by a bus or something and dies.
                   (he puts the form down

</b><b>   
</b><b>   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
</b><b>   
</b>   Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
   Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             What's the problem?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.
             That's why I need you, backup.

</b><b>   TRUNK
</b><b>   
</b>   The trunk of a car is opened.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
   action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
   of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
   a playing piece.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b><b>   TRUNK
</b><b>   
</b>   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
<b>   
</b>   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
<b>   
</b>   Cool, old-school R&amp;B fills the cab.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
<b>   
</b>   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
<b>   
</b>   ... then stops.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
<b>   
</b>   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
<b>   
</b>   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
<b>   
</b>   The cab goes black.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Don't worry. It's just me.
<b>   
</b>   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&amp;B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell drives the Olds away.

</b><b>   
</b>   Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
   from one channel to another with a remote control,
   drinking cocktails from a can.
<b>   
</b>   The phone rings. He answers it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Hello.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
   Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
   phone next to his ear.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Whatcha watchin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
             and forth. They had some black girl
             from some black show on Jay Leno. I
             watched that for a bit, but I kept
             flippin channels cause I didn't know
             who she was.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I dunno.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I know you don't know. I said guess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
             cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
             outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You're outside?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             C'mon in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
             comfortable. I ain't about to walk
             into that roach motel and get
             uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
             here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I'm in my underwear.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Then put your goddam drawers on, and
             get your ass out here. I got
             somethin' to show you.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
   his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
   in front of the motel.
<b>   
</b>   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
   in his seat looking up at Louis.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You know what your problem is, Louis?
<b>   
</b>   Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
   pockets.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)

             go into a deal you don't go in
             prepared to take that motherfucker
             all the way. You go in looking for a
             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're
             different, me and you. Cause me, once
             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
             get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
             Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
             removed. Understand what I'm saying?

</b><b>   CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
</b><b>   
</b>   Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
   his head blown off.
<b>   
</b>   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell closes the trunk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b>             Who was Beaumont?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             An employee I had to let go.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             What did he do?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             He put himself in a situation where
             he was gonna have to do ten years in
             the penetentiary, that's what he did.
                   (taking out a Viceroy and
                   lighting it up)
             And if you know Beaumont, you know
             there aint no way in hell he can do
             no ten years. And if you know that,
             you know Beaumont's gonna go any
             goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
             from doin' those ten years including
             telling the Federal government
             everything they want to know about my
             ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear

             believe it aint gonna be me. You know
             what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
             this with me, you gotta be prepared
             to go all the way. I got me so far
             over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
             in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
             Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one

             this little cheese eatin' nigga here
             fuck that up? Shit, you better think
             again. 'Fore I let this deal get

</b><b>   "LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"
</b><b>   
</b>   We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
   at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
   opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
   she walks down the row of cars.
<b>   
</b><b>                       VOICE (O.S.)
</b>             Miss Brown.
<b>   
</b>   She turns towards the voice/camera.
<b>   
</b>   Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
   holding open his I.D. case.
<b>

</b>             Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
             L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
             that bag?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The usual things. I'm a flight
             attendant with Cabo Air.

<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Can I be of some assistance?
<b>   
</b>   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
   purse, she says to Ray;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I doubt it.
                   (to Dargus)

</b>             This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet

             Would you mind if we looked in that
             bag?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             You have the right to say "no." And I
             have the right to make you wait here
             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Suspicion of what?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             All he wants to do is peek in your
             bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
             anything.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shrugs and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Go ahead.

<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
             thousand dollars here. What would you
             say Ray?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             That looks like fifty thousand
             dollars from here.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b>   Not saying anything at the moment.
<b>

             to declare it. You forgot or what?
             You could get a two hundred and fifty

</b>             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like

</b>             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny

             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in

<b>   
</b>   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."

</b>             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.

</b>   Not a word.

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DARGUS AND NICOLET
</b><b>   
</b>   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not a loser.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet joins back in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Help yourself.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
<b>   
</b>   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             My pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS

</b>   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I'll count the money.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             What's this?

</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's my diet shit.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Let's see what else is in there.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             And what would this be, Sweet and

             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'

</b>   The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF

             bond will be set at one-thousand

             request one at twenty- five thousand
             based on your prior record and risk
             of flight. If you don't post it or
             don't know anyone who can, you'll

</b>   The P.D. rises.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JUDGE
</b>             The charge is possession of Narcotics

</b>             Very well...

</b><b>                       DARGUS

<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
             defendant's prior conviction and the
             extreme possibility of flight due to
             her occupation, the State requests a
             bond of no less than twenty-five
             thousand.

</b>   The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...
<b>   
</b><b>                       JUDGE
</b>             I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
             the date of August 14th for the
             arraignment.

             then. Owens, case 72242.

</b>             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             The bond for possession is only a

</b>             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'

             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit

             Possession.

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and

</b>             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
<b>

             What you have to do, in case you

             thousand bucks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.

             you're right. It ain't shit.
<b>

</b>             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
<b>

             don't have a tab.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
<b>

</b>             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Okay, man. I got your money. But

<b>   
</b>   Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
   She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
   envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
   Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
   with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
   Jackie Brown's a knockout.

             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
<b>

             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.

<b>

</b>             With ten thousand? Nine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He's got that kinda money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Cash poor?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets exasperated.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Ask A.T.F. They might give you
             permission.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, if I cooperate.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
             gonna have to give 'em something.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
             name - I don't really know shit about
             what he does or how he does it - That
             don't give me much to bargain with.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
             Show a willingness to be helpful. You
             want to stay out of jail, don't you?
<b>   
</b>   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.

</b>   Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
   from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
   Cash is playing inside his car.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL'S POV
</b><b>   
</b>   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
   off.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b>   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
<b>   
</b>   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
   moment, then Jackie opens the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I was expecting you. Come in.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie holds the door open for him.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
   the living room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You got some booze?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
   frightened.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got some vodka in the freezer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Got some o.j.?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, then, why don't you be a good
             hostess and make me a screwdriver?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
   doesn't turn on the light.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You gonna thank me?
<b>   
</b>   Taking a glass from the cupboard.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             For what?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Who you think got your ass outta
             jail?
<b>   
</b>   Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
   and taking out vodka.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The same guy who put me in, thanks a

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
             our business.
<b>   
</b>   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It wasn't mine.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell has to stop and think.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie makes screwdriver.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
             Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
             Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
             there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
             shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
             apologize. I 'magine they asked you a

             All that money, want to know where
             you got it?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I'magine they asked who you givin' it

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They asked.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And what was your answer?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie says to his face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're not asking the right
             questions.
<b>   
</b>   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b>   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I didn't tell 'em anything.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             My name come up?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b>   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You say anything about me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They told me.
<b>   
</b>   At this moment the film becomes a:
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SPLIT SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX IN CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
<b>   
</b>   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL AND JACKIE

</b>             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You scared of me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
<b>   
</b>   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hears a CLICK.
<b>   
</b>   Can't believe it.

</b>   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Baby, I ain't come here -
<b>   
</b>   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I understand woman, damn!
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Go sit over in that chair.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sits.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Put both hands behind our head.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell does...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This shits gettin silly now...
<b>   
</b>   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   A coffee table lays between them.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I just came here to talk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             - Baby, I didn't -
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, very interested.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got a problem...
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All your money's in Mexico.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               TIME CUT:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DOORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (O.S.)
</b>             Talk to you tomorrow.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell leaves.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE TO BLACK
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   OVER BLACK
</b><b>   
</b>   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE UP ON:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SAME SHOT DORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
<b>   
</b>   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
<b>   
</b>   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
<b>   
</b>   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
<b>   
</b>   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you're having some.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I am. Have a seat.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You get a chance to use it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Black's fine.
<b>   
</b>   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Thanks, but I have my own now.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
<b>   
</b>   She turns off the water.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What, I couldn't hear you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
<b>   
</b>   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's just say I got one, okay?
<b>   
</b>   She turns on the coffeemaker.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Somebody loan it to you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
<b>   
</b>   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Want to hear some music?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It looks nice.
<b>   
</b>   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
<b>   
</b>   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't buy new stuff that often.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
<b>   
</b>   Max listens to the soul song.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             This is pretty.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Who is this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The Delfonics.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's nice.
<b>   
</b>   They listen for a moment.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I called in sick this morning. As far
             as the airline knows, I'm still
             available.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Are you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and
             see what happens.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What I meant was have a lawyer do the
             negotiating for you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             How'd you find that out?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He told me last night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He called you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He came by.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What?... What'd you do?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We talked.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
<b>   
</b>   She pours the coffee.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             How do you get it out?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You're gonna offer to set him up?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
             'em.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's very possible Ordell's killed
             somebody.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
             doin' that probation thing again.
<b>   
</b>   Max watches her a moment
<b>   
</b>   Jackie takes a drink of coffee.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             How do you feel about getting old?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You're not old. You look great.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm asking how you feel. Does it
             bother you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's not really something I think
             about.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Really?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about
             it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             How'd you feel about it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
             done it, I did it to feel better
             about myself, and I do. When I look
             in the mirror it looks like me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

</b>             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   FADE UP ON ON TV
</b><b>   
</b>   Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
   proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
   Policier from the seventies.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
   hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
   a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
   Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
   and a loose top.
<b>   
</b>   The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
   it carrying shopping bags.

<b>   
</b>   We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
   "look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
   jeans.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie notices the change.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)

<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
<b>   
</b>   Louis smiles to himself.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
<b>

</b>             The Cockatoo Inn.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a cockatoo.

             coughing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hangs up the phone.

             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
<b>   
</b>   Louis with a smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Way ahead of you.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
<b>   
</b>   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)

<b>   
</b>   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;

   around and looks at Louis.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No thanks.
<b>   
</b>   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
<b>   
</b>   He looks around and spots something interesting.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
</b><b>   
</b>   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
<b>   
</b>   Louis picks up the photo frame.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             How old were you here?
<b>   
</b>   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             The roller disco one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I was pretty much the same height now
             as I was then.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Were you a disco girl?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             So where did you go?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.

   till she hits Stop!
<b>   
</b>   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.

</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.
                   (he points to the cut

</b>             You been to Japan?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I lived there for about nine months.

</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You lived in Japan, when?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             About five years ago.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Must of made quite an impression.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MEALINE
</b>             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That sounds like a problem.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.

</b>   Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
   middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I gotta remember this place. This is

<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Look, the only way I can get
             permission to fly is if I agree to
             help them. Which is what I have to
             appear to be doing. So I give them
             something they already know. You.

<b>

             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.

</b><b>   INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY

<b>   
</b>   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
<b>   
</b>   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANI
</b>             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
<b>   
</b>   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             He seems to be making out.

</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Is it dead?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   She starts preparing a bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
<b>   
</b>   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
   while holding in the smoke, says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             He killed a man worked for him the

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's not what I'm saying at all.

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Please.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

             tell you about that half-million

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Course he did, he tells everybody
             who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             And your point is?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Let him and that stewardess get that
             money over here...
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b>   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKI
</b>             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             That's a good idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Who?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know. One of your friends.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             A woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you want.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, I think a woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             But you don't?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I give it to someone else first.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's the idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So we need two people, two women.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Can you cover that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Managers get ten percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'll give ya ten.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Plus the same deal as before.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I can do that.

</b>   It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
   dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
<b>   
</b>   She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
   the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
   flashing. She hits play.

</b>   The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
   week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
   not like it is on the weekend.
<b>   
</b>   The international food court, where fast-food versions of
   international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
   Amo Mall shoppers.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
   drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
   Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.
<b>   
</b>   We join in mid-conversation.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The money's in a Broadway shopping
             bag. I get some food, and sit down
             here in the food court. Then your

</b><b>   INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
   theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
   seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
   having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
   them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b>   In the food court.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell rises from the table.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Don't forget your bag.
<b>   
</b>   He takes it.
<b>   
</b>   We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
   stops...
<b>   
</b>   ... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
   "What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"
<b>   
</b>   As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
   court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             walks into the food court. He stands
             looking a all the international fast
             food choices in front of him. As he
             tries to decide, he hears from behind

</b>   He approaches her table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Does it happen to all men?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And Annette's it for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
<b>   
</b>   With a smile on her face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Who was your girl before Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm old enough to be her father.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             How old's Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b>   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>

</b>             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You don't actually do it that way?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right around here, in the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sit down, leave the bag under the

<b>   
</b>   Jackie nods her head "yes."
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             Will Ordell go for that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He was here?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I called you last night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You think he's got a thing for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.

</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I see.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has he hinted around?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know some interesting people.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
<b>   
</b>   She shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He tries to act cool.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What about you Max?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're avoiding the question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             When did you decide?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.

</b>             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a

             come home.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's

<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)

<b>   
</b>   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Shoot him with the stun gun. While

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You do that?

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Did you do it that night?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
<b>

</b>   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you had a chance, unemployed now,

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b>   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the

   very different from the first time they met. The three

<b>   
</b>   She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
   beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway

<b>   
</b>   Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
   sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
   Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
   serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,

   her the ashtray Jackie was using.

             about four blocks away I got me this
             nineteen-year-old country girl named
             Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
             bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
             country as a chicken coop. Took her
             to my house in Compton, told her it
             was Hollywood.

             Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
             twenty minutes after I'm out the

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right. Everything's the same, except

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
<b>   
</b>   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Do you think they bought it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know, a good cop won't let you
             know he knows you're fulla shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.

             one change. Ordell thinks it's just
             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
             stash where it is, but he wants to
             bring in fifty thousand for bail in
             case he needs it.

             be Melanie.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
   Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
   watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.

</b><b>   
</b>   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
   pursued by police cars.
<b>   
</b>   They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
   gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
   So knock it of."
<b>

</b><b>   
</b>   Louis stands in the empty living room, talking to Ordell
   on the phone. Kate Bush plays in the b.g.

</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
   retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, you the one in motherfuckin'

<b>   
</b>   He hangs up on Louis.
<b>   
</b>   Louis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like
   that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where
   it rightly belongs - Melanie.
<b>   
</b>   Louis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's
   playing.

</b><b>   "TIME 3:52"
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
   goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
   the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
<b>   
</b>   Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
   fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
   thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
   envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
   the rest of the bag with beach towels.
<b>   
</b>   Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
   carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
   confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
   the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
   around. Any one of them could be surveillance.
<b>   
</b>   She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
   Roinson's/May store.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young
   Asian saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's/May designer
   clothing area.
<b>   
</b>   The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
             on.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
   sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             This looks pretty good on me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Are you kidding, it looks great. You
             wear this to a business meeting,
             you're the badass in the room. But
             you can go out dancing in this too.
             It's a total power suit.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie studies her reflection.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I think I'm gonna just get this for

             you mind ringing this up while I

<b>   
</b>   Jackie walks into the fitting room.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
   cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
<b>   
</b>   She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
   her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
<b>   
</b>   A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
   looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
   next to her.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MEALNIE (O.S.)
</b>             Jackie?

</b>             Hi, Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>             Are you getting that black suit?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, do you like it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>             It looks good on you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Do you got something for me?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>             You betcha.
<b>   
</b>   A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
   comes sliding underneath the stall.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
   books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
<b>   
</b>   She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
   and lies it on top of the bag.
<b>   
</b>   As she does all this Melanie continues talking.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             We coulda worked this. You know that,

             better than you're going to, believe
             me.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
   stall.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I put a little cherry on top. You're
             right. What the hell he ever do for
             us?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>                   (quietly)
             Thanks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Now be careful with that bag. You
             don't want it ripping open on you in
             the middle of the store.
<b>   
</b>   We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
   of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
   sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
<b>   
</b>   Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
   She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
   Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
   frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
   counter where Amy waits for her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
             the suit - get out of that damn

<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Oh, that's not a problem.
<b>   
</b>   As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
   the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
   RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
   as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
<b>   
</b>   She leaves. We follow her...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   ... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
   main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
   Jackie is completely gone.
<b>   
</b>   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
   she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
   tears.
<b>   
</b>   As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
             took the money.
<b>   
</b>   The CAMERA stops twirling.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
   running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
   a frantic Jackie yells;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Melanie burst in the dressing room
             and took the money!

</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   ... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose
   them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
   but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
   in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
   floor.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AM

</b>   We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
   watching Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's a nice outfit on her. I'm

</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>   
</b>   Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
   dampness.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Job a little too much for you?
<b>   
</b>   Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
   a natural-born smart ass to change.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I'll be over here. You're too
             conspicuous.
<b>   
</b>   Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
   inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
   him.
<b>   
</b>   He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
<b>   
</b>   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX CHERRY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
<b>   
</b>   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
<b>   
</b>   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
<b>   
</b>   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
<b>   
</b>   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b>   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.

<b>   
</b>   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

</b>             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
<b>   
</b>   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Fuck you with your chill pill.
<b>   
</b>   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;

<b>   
</b>   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie

</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie follows close behind.
<b>   
</b>   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
<b>   
</b>   Louis doesn't answer.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Jesus, but if you two aren't the

             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
<b>   
</b>   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
<b>

</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b>   They walk it; it's not it.
<b>   
</b>   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)

</b>   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, Lou-is.
<b>   
</b>   That did it!
<b>   
</b>   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
<b>   
</b>   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
<b>   
</b>   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
<b>   
</b>   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
<b>   
</b>   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
<b>   
</b>   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
<b>   
</b>   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Hey, look. I found it!
<b>   
</b>   He drives away.

</b>   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

</b><b>   
</b>   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
<b>   
</b>   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Can I show you something?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks, I won't.
<b>   
</b>   She goes off.
<b>   
</b>   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>                   (low)
             And away we go.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
<b>   
</b>   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
<b>   
</b>   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
<b>   
</b>   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues his fake browsing.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
<b>   
</b>   She and Louis disappear.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
<b>   
</b>   She's gone.
<b>   
</b>   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
<b>   
</b>   It's Max's turn.
<b>   
</b>   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
<b>   
</b>   Max takes a few moments...
<b>   
</b>   ... then walks over to Amy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
<b>   
</b>   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Got 'em, thanks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Sure thing.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
<b>   
</b>   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
<b>   
</b>   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
<b>

</b><b>   INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
   and watching a stripper strip.

</b><b>                       BARTENDER
</b>             There a Ordell here?

   Ordell's tiny cellular.

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I haven't even looked at it yet, it's

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That's what I got to talk to you

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

   in, the car takes off.

</b><b>   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
   backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
   lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where

             We're gonna leave this heap in a
             parking lot and get one the cops
             don't know about.
                   (pause)
             Hey, where's Melanie?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So what, you left her there.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I shot her.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell just looks at him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
</b>             I expect she's dead.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You shot Melanie?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Twice. In the parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Couldn't talk to her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You know how she is.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You couldn't just hit her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Maybe... but at that moment... I
             dunno...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You shot her twice?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So you're sure she's dead.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Pretty sure.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Where did you shoot her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             In the chest and stomach.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, if you had to do it, you had to
             do it. What we don't want is that
             bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
             that woman.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
<b>   
</b>   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)

<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b>                   (calm)
             So you light, ain't you. You light
             about a half-a-million.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Look, that's the bag she came out
             with. She never even put her hand in
             it, and neither did I.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Came outta where?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             The fitting room. It went down

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             How long was she in there?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Maybe a minute. She came right out.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You sure she ain't somewhere with a

             ass off to earn?
<b>   
</b>   Louis looks at Ordell;

</b>                   (quietly)

</b>   Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
   smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.

</b><b>                       LOUIS (CONT'D)

</b>             You didn't. I would think with all

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag

             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my

</b>             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend

             was glad to see that. You've been

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             All Winston had to do was ask around.
             Ordell's living in Long Beach with a

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             People talk to Winston. He's street,
             same as them, they trust him. They
             get busted, they know somebody who
             can bond them out. I thought I might
             drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
             surprised to see me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He's liable to shoot you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             On the phone I told him I have the
             ten thousand he put up for your bond.
             I could bring the money and the
             papers for him to sign. Walk out and
             call the Sheriff's department.

</b>   Jackie gets off the bed.

</b>             Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
             suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
             him in, he's gonna name you as an

</b>   Jackie lights up a Davidoff.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
             case. I'm their witness. They
             wouldn't have a case without me. If
             it's his word against mine, who are

             more or less doesn't care. All he

</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
   her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
   the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b>   Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
   the lights. The office goes dark. No music.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
</b><b>   
</b>   The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
   slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
   sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b>   Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
   Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
   illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
   drag. No music.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSEUP ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b>   His face is ice, the music is LOUD.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSEUP JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b>   She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
</b><b>   
</b>   Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's the next street.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I know where it is.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Turn left.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I know where to turn.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b>   Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
   window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
   sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
</b><b>   
</b>   Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
   off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             My money's in that office, right?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             She starts givin' me some bullshit
             about it ain't there. It's somewhere
             else and we can go get it.
                   (he holds up his Beretta)
             I'm shootin' you in the head right
             then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
             her in the kneecap, find out where my
             godamn money is. I go walkin' in
             there and that nigga Winston or
             anybody else is in there, you're the
             first man shot, understand what I'm
             sayin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Now, is there anything you want to
             tell me before we get out of this
             car?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You better be, motherfucker.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
   in his pants.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Get ahead of me and open the door.
<b>   
</b>   Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
   opens the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Step inside easy.
<b>   
</b>   Max does.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
             in the goddamn dark for?
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
   bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
   Then Jackie says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Mark...
                   (raising her voice)
             ... he's got a gun!
<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
   Beretta in his pants...
<b>   
</b>   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
<b>   
</b>   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
<b>   
</b>   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             He's dead.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus looks up at Max;
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
</b>             Does he have the marked bills on him?
<b>   
</b>   Max still shaken;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             In his inside coat pocket.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks at Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus looks up at Max;
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Why were you with him?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I went to give him his refund, so he
             wouldn't have to come here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             How'd you know where he was?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I found out.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             And you didn't tell the Police?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
             wanted him.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Remember when Ray said you hoped
             you'd get him before he got me?
<b>   
</b>   Dargus looks up and nods his head.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Well, you did. Thank you.
<b>   
</b>   She takes a drag on her Davidoff.
<b>

</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
   morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.
<b>   
</b><b>   A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   "TEN DAYS LATER"
</b><b>   
</b>   Max hears someone go;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (O.S.)
</b>             Knock knock.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
   doorway. She smiles at him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Hey.
<b>   
</b>   MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)

</b>   Max smiles back.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Hey, you.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie walks toward him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got your package. It was fun
             getting a half-a-million dollars in
             the mail.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Less ten percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
             out, since there wasn't no note.
<b>   
</b>   She sits in the chair in front of his desk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I hesitated taking that much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
             you want.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm sure.

</b>             Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.

<b>   
</b>   As she stands, Jackie says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He's on to a new thing. He's after a
             guy who owns a gun shop he says is
             "woefully and wantonly" selling
             assault rifles to minors. He says
             he's gonna take him down if it's the

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Did you tell him you were leaving?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I told him I might.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
   convertible.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             That's Ordell's.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They've confiscated all his other

             over. The registration's in the glove
             box, the keys were under the seat...
             What's a matter" haven't you ever
             borrowed someone's car?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Not after they're dead.
<b>   
</b>   She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
   at him across the black Mercedes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I didn't use you, Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I didn't say you did.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I never lied to you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I know.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Do you blame yourself for helping me?
<b>   
</b>   He shakes his head 'no.'
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A little bit.

                      Larry and Andy Wachowski

<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK
</b>
     We know that we are looking at something because its
     polished surface shimmers with light.

     PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and
     white tiles of a chess board.

     The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find
     ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess
     game.

     The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other
     pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces
     are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies
     unravel towards a final outcome.

     Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black
     king.

     We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled
     ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold
     black eyes...

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>     EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK
</b>
     The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.

     Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
     less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and
     the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball
     of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
     mire.

     The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
     He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber
     gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.

     His name is ROBERT RATH.

     The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a
     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
     brambles and mud.

     As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
     mud.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Aw-shit!

     He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
     the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
     He looks at Rath.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               How much farther?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Just a little ways.  Up to those
               trees.

     About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
     is a small cluster of trees.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Oh, fuck it.

     He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
     He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting
     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He
     grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.

     Rath waits, a faint smile.

     He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
     both feet into the dark, wet earth.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Hey, this feels kinda good.

     They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
     deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Hey, do you mind if I talk a
               little?  I feel like, I don't
               know, talking I guess.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Sure.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Funny, I've never been a talker.
               My wife was always getting on me
               about that.  'Say what you feel,
               tell me what's bothering you,
               you ve got to talk to me.'  I
               never would though.  Not really.

<b>                               RATH
</b>               Why not?

<b>                               KETCHAM
</b>               I don't know.  Part of me wanted
               to but part of me always said,
               'What's she going to be able to
               do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I
               didn't trust her.

     He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
     snowball.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               My Margaret... I loved her but you
               know what?  I cheated on her.  All
               the time.  I don't even know why.
               It wasn't the sex, Margaret was
               great in bed.  I think if I wasn't
               married I wouldn't have even looked
               at some of those women.  I knew she
               couldn't trust me, so how could I
               trust her?  If she was here right
               now I'd think that I would tell her
               that I was sorry... 'course, if she
               were here right now, maybe I
               wouldn't feel like talking.

     He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
     too far.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I think I've heard of you.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's possible.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               You're pretty famous aren't you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I hope not.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I know this may seem like a strange
               question, but can I ask you how
               much the contract was for -- not
               to insult you or anything, I know
               you're a professional, but just
               for me, I was just wondering.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's a common question.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to
               see that price tag.  Like art,
               right?  You hang some painting
               that looks like baby-puke in your
               living room only if it costs a
               bundle.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               A dime.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               One hundred thousand?  That's it?
               Jesus... Is that a lot?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Average.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Shit... oh well.

     Ketcham laughs.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I have been thinking about this
               for a long while.  I knew this day
               was coming.  I knew someday
               someone would make the call on me.
               I never thought about anyone that
               I had whacked.  What do you call
               it anyway?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Taken.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had
               someone taken I would call our
               General Contractor, transfer the
               money and as soon as I hung up the
               phone I forgot about them.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Everyone who plays the game knows
               the rules.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               That's exactly what I told myself.

     Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like
     he's high.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I always wondered what I'd be
               thinking at this exact moment.  I
               imagined that I would be thinking
               about the fucker who contracted
               this, trying to figure out who
               it was...

     Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Don't know.  That's how it works.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               That's what our General Contractor
               told us but how can you trust
               someone like that?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Right.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I thought that I would be thinking
               about Margaret, or work, or that
               I'd be having these deep, profound
               and depressing thoughts but I'm
               not.  I'm trying to think really
               profound thoughts, but I can't.
               It seems very funny to me.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What are you thinking about?

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't
               that funny?  I haven't had a
               Moonpie since I was ten years old.
               Right now, I'm thinking how much
               I'd love one.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               And an R.C.

     He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly
     stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Can I ask you something?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Go ahead.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               What do other guys do?

     He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Everyone handles it differently.
               Some are ready, some are not.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Do they get down on their knees,
               begging and crying?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Some.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               When I thought about this, that
               was always there, in the back of
               my head, that image of me on my
               knees, crying.  It wouldn't go
               away and it would really upset me.
               It was something that I could never
               get away from... but now, I feel
               it's okay.  I feel good.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Can I ask you a question?

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Anything.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why didn't you fade?

<b>                              KETCHAM
</b>               You mean quit?

<b>                              RATH
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                              KETCHAM
</b>               I used to think about it.  I had
               Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I
               thought about moving somewhere
               far away like, Europe.  I could
               see all of that, the first part,
               the getting away but I couldn't
               see that next part.  'Then what?'
               So I'd stop thinking about it and
               go back to work.  You understand?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yeah.

     Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
     trees.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               I always pictured that I would end
               in some land fill, under
               someone else's garbage.  I kept
               picturing those plastic diapers
               filled with some baby's green shit,
               covering me.  But this is nice...

     He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black
     horizon.

<b>                               KETCHAM
</b>               Look at that.  I haven't watched
               the sun set in a million years.
               Do you mind?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

     Ketcham stares at the last of the light.

<b>                             KETCHAM
</b>               Nice... real nice.

     With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.

     Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath
     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.

     When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
     ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY
     FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE
<b>     SHOTS.
</b>
     Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
     left by the dying sun.

     Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
     ing alone in the middle of nowhere.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
     The room is dark and still.

     A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
     amber wash of urban light.

     Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the
     city's electric night.

     The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty
     glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
     his forehead rests against the window.

     In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath.

     Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
     Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the
     distant street below.

     He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
     fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door.

     Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the
     bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed
     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
     that her dress is very short and very tight.

<b>                             ESCORT (WOMAN)
</b>               Hi.  Did you call --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.  Please come in.

     Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters
     and he takes her coat.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Goodness, it's so dark...

     She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I prefer it like this.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               How can a beautiful man like you
               be shy?

     He smiles.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I prefer it, that's all.

     She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her
     body radiating like heat.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               It's okay, honey.  We can do it
               anyway you want.

     Rath is obviously uncomfortable.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Would you like a drink?

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               I'd love one.  Whatever you're
               having.

     They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless
     as two shadows.

     She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a
     city night.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Beautiful.

     He hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Good will towards men.

     Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she
     drinks at all, we can not tell.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why are you working today?

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Holidays are our busiest days.  No
               one likes to be alone on holidays.
               I know I don't.

     She touches his face, the caress and her expression of
     tenderness seemingly genuine.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're very good at this aren't
               you?

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               I think you're supposed to answer
               that question.

     Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any
     farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I know what you expect, but I
               don't want...

     He pours himself another drink.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               That's okay, hon, I always expect
               the unexpected.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I called because I just want... I
               need to talk.

     She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she
     becomes a listener.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I've been thinking about my life,
               about things I have done... What I
               do for a living is in some ways
               similiar to what you do.

     He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened
     by the alcohol.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I know that everything has a
               price.  I want you to understand
               that I'm willing to pay.

     He takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She
     picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred
     dollar bills.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               For what?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Honesty.

     She puts the envelope down.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I just want to ask you some
               questions.

     Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for
     the right words.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Do you ever regret things you've

</b>               But when you finLsh a job,

               wouldn't exist.

     Rath nods.  His next question is barely audible.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Do you ever think about starting

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Can you tell me about it?

     For the first time we really see her take a drink.  She
     closes her eyes.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Sometimes I dream that I meet a
               man, this good, honest man and we
               fall in love.  I imagine us living
               on a boat, reading books, sailing
               to places where no one knows who
               we were or cares what we did.

     She opens her eyes and looks at him.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               And what if you never meet that

     She smiles.

<b>                             ESCORT
</b>               Then, I'll sail alone.

     Rath nods.

</b>               I have to.

     She finishes her drink.

     She picks up the money and stands.

<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
     It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room
     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about.

     He has been here for a while.

     He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess
     game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
     same positions as in the opening sequence.

     He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.

     He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
     over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a
     black rook.

     A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving
     both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He
     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,
     studying the game from white's perspective.

     Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
     it as he moves around the table, returning to his place
     behind the black king.

     The games reaches its end as black is check-mated.

     He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
     white king.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Fuck you, Nick.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAWN
</b>
     Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
     office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
     machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer.

     On the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled
     and cleaned, spread out on a white towel.

     He types in a complicated access code sequence, then
     waits, staring at the blank screen.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Where have you been, Robert?

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               Sick.  The flu.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               I don't believe you.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I don't give a fuck --

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               It's true.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               I have been sitting on a contract
               from Cleveland for six days
               because of you.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck
               your contracts --

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               I need a rest.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN
</b>               That's impossible, Robert.  You're
               at the top of your field.  These
               are the best contracts.  To stop
               now would be self-destructive.

     He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
     the table.

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               Send the file.  I'll have the
               estimate tonight.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               I'm worried about you, Robert.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You fucking should be --

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               Don't be.

     On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears.  Rath
     slowly gets out of his chair.

     The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph
     of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk.

     Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything
     he can get his hands on.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
</b>
     Rath is in the middle of the room which he has
     demolished.  Having showered and shaved, he is now
     standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing
     the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
     Rath is working at the desk.  He is tallying numbers,
     materials, totaling his estimate.

     Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
     the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by
     bodyguards.

     The file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It
     includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account
     statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the
     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
     income tax return.

     Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the
     modem and makes a call.

     The network comes on-line as the General Contractor
     types:

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               You're too late, Robert.

     Rath types.

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               What?

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               The contract was stolen.

     Rath stares at the screen.

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               Who?

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               A new player.  He's using the name
               Nicholai.

     The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               You know what must be done.

     The screen goes black as the network shuts down.

     Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts
     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
     appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been
     circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma."


<b>     EXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT
</b>
     A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian
     restaurant.


<b>     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA
</b>
     It is a large establishment with many tables and booths.
     The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian
     families who have been eating here for years.

     Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle
     changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian.

     In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine.
     He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies
     the room.

     LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
     gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet
     them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian.

     The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-
     sized booth in the back.

     Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is
     watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin.

     Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
     around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the
     room.

     A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
     fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming
     loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
     front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles.
     They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back
     to the kitchen.

     At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their
     glasses.

     It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
     to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is
     the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is
     BAIN.  He smiles.

     The goon reaches for his gun as --

     Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He
     screams.

     Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free
     from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm.

     It happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead.

     Leevio screams.

<b>                             LEEVIO
</b>               Don't!

     A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT.

     Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table.

     Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON
     from his belt expecting an attack.

     Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who
     moves or stands, men or women.

     There is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling
     to the ground, scrambling under tables.

     Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of
     the room to the other.

     The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who
     are sobbing.

     He moves through the room, watching, searching.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Don't anybody move.  You move,
               you're dead.

     He passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Come on, you chicken shit
               motherfucker.  I know you're here.
               Let's go.


<b>     EXT. CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together
     a German assault rifle with night scope.


<b>     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA
</b>
     Bain looks out the window at the dark street.

     He turns and searches through the people huddled on the
     floor.  He aims his gun.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You!  Get up!

     A quivering wine steward stands.

     He points to another.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You, too!  Up!


<b>     EXT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the
     restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
     together slowly back out.


<b>     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA
</b>
     Bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the
     stewards.

     One of them begins to cry.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Not yet.  Don't move or you're
               fucking dead.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out
     the assassin.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Shit.  Just do them all.  All of
               them.  Shit.

     He can't pull the trigger.


<b>     EXT. TRATTORIA STOREFRONT
</b>
     The group moves toward the street.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Now run!

     Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath watches as they scatter, finding Bain in his scope.


<b>     EXT. STREET
</b>
     A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bain's
     head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
     curb.  He laughs.  We get the idea that Bain is enjoying
     this.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath looks over his scope, talking to himself.  He is
     sweating.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Shit.  What are you doing, old man?
               You're too fucking slow.

     He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
     of cars.

<b>                              RATH
</b>               Okay.  Which one?  Which one is
               yours?


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars,
     staying low and out of sight.

     He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked
     illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys.
     He hits the remote unlocking the doors.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured
     by the parked Mercedes.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Amateur.

     He takes aim.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front TIRE
     EXPLODES.  Another second, the back TIRE EXPLODES.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Fuck!


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Your move.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     Bain hears the growing wail of POLICE SIRENS.  Thinking
     for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long
     handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from
     the glove compartment.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what
     Bain is doing.  The SIRENS are GETTING LOUDER.  There's a
     lot of them.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls
     his shirt sleeve down.  From his pocket he takes out a
     Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris."


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath watches as the police cars come racing down the
     street.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     The CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of the restaurant.
     The COPS jump out, drawing their weapons.

     Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I give
               up!

     More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold
     their beads on Bain.

<b>                             COP
</b>               Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread
               your legs!

     Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,
     frisking him.  In this position the Cop is unable to find
     the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the
     Gameboy.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Hey, don't touch that!

<b>                             COP
</b>               Shut up!

     The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing
     him tightly.

     They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and
     paramedics in the street.


<b>     INT. PARKING GARAGE
</b>
     Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the
     police car, but is unable to get a clean shot.  Bain is
     using the cops for cover, keeping his head low.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Son of a bitch.

     The Cops shove Bain into the back seat.

     Rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into
     the trunk.  He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE.


<b>     INT. PATROL CAR
</b>
     The two Officers are outside the car talking with the
     sergeant.

     Bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the
     shadowy parking garage.  He smiles.

     The two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up
     the radio.  The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and
     white RUMBLES down the street.

<b>                             COP #2
</b>               This is 181, returning with suspect
               involved in multiple shooting at
               Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route
               with suspect.

     He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the
     metal caging.

<b>                             COP #2
</b>               Jesus Christ, do you know who you

     Bain almost laughs.

<b>                             COP #2
</b>               What are you?  Some kind of a
               hitman?

     Bain looks out the window.

<b>                             COP #2
</b>               You know what we call guys like you?

     Bain looks at him.

<b>                             COP #2
</b>               Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your
               ass.

     He laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who
     chuckles.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
     Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with
     the patrol car.


<b>     INT. PATROL CAR
</b>
     Bain stares out the window, silent.

     Behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his
     right hand.

     The Cop is playing with the Gameboy.

     With a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket.
     His expression remains perfectly blank.

     The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  The skin
     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
     wrist.

     The Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks
     the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  A
     font of blood arcs onto the windshield.

     Grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the
     blade into the back of his neck.

     The driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip.

     He slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the CAR
     SKIDS out of control.

     Bain stabs the Cop again, his GUN FIRING WILDLY as --

     The patrol car starts to flip and roll.


<b>     INT. RATH'S CAR
</b>
     Rath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION, several blocks away.
     The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right.


<b>     EXT. STREET
</b>
     Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
     patrol car.  Oil black clouds billow into the night sky.

     Rath's car cruises past.

     Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.

     Bain is gone.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm not done yet.


<b>     EXT. CITY STREET INTERSECTION
</b>
     A brand new cab is sitting at a red light.

     The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of
     headlights roll up behind him.  The car gets closer, the
     lights brighter; they don't stop.

     He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS
<b>     BUMPER.
</b>
     The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.

     Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as
     the cabby moves toward him.

     When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him
     unconscious.

     He picks him up and puts him in the white car.

     Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
     green, he drives off.


<b>     INT. CAB
</b>
     Rath circles the area, turning up the cab's CB.

     A couple of CALLS CRACKLE through the speaker, before he
     hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area.
     At the intersection of Adams and Nine.

     He picks up the mike.

<b>                              RATH
</b>               This is 1242.  I got it.


<b>     EXT. ADAMS AND NINE
</b>
     It is a deserted intersection.  The buildings are dark and
     some of the street lights are out.

     The cab sits by itself, ENGINE RUNNING, its taillights
     glowing through the exhaust.


<b>     INT. CAB
</b>
     Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat.  His other
     hand grips the door handle.

     As he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the
     cabby's ID pinned to the dashboard.

     Leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the ID card.

     He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the
     seat, the door behind him opens.  Someone gets in and
     closes the door.  Rath peers into the rearview mirror.

     It is Bain.

     For the first time we realize that the front and back of
     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.

     There is an awkward silence as Rath sits, unsure.

     Bain looks at him.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Is there a problem?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  No problem.  The airport,
               right?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Right.

     The cab pulls out of the intersection.


<b>     INT. CAB
</b>
     Rath studies Bain.  There is a thin line of blood down his
     temple.  Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his
     Gameboy, resuming his game of Tetris.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               How'd you cut yourself?

     Their voices are distorted through the small electric
     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
     money exchanger.

     Bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a
     bit surprised.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Oh?  Working.  A little accident.

     He wipes it off as best he can.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You a waiter?  You look like a
               waiter.

     Bain is uninterested.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Where?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What restaurant?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Uh, Fontella's

<b>                             RATH
</b>               So you're from around here?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               No.  No I'm not.

     Bain is getting agitated.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Where you from?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What is this?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Not too good at small talk, eh?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Look, I'm real tired and I'm not
               interested in fucking chit-chat.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I know just what you mean.  I'm
               pretty beat myself.

     Silence.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Since you looked like a waiter, I
               had to ask what restaurant because
               of what happened at the Trattoria
               Roma.

     Bain looks up.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Why?  What happened?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Didn't you here all them sirens?
               It's been all over the radio.  Some
               guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch
               of bystanders, in the Trattoria
               Roma.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               No shit.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli,
               and I don't care what office he's
               running for, the guy's a crook.  He
               probably had it coming, but all the
               other people.  Real sad.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               But they caught the guy.  I heard it
               all.  Sounded like he just went
               berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting
               anybody.  Drugs, probably.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Probably.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send
               that S.O.B. right to the chair.

     Bain allows himself a bemused smile.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Sizzle lean.

     The cab passes the intersection for the airport.

     Bain sits up.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               That was Peterson back there.  That
               goes to the expressway for the
               airport.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're right.  Talking too much
               again.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yeah well, you just blew your tip,
               pal.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What?  You think I'm running you up?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Just do your job.

     Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Get out.  You think I'm running you
               up?  Get out.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You can't --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I
               don't like you.  So, get the hell
               out!

     Bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the
     dashboard and the missing ID.

     Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Holy fucking shit!

     The cab rocks as both men move.  Instantly guns fill their
     hands.  Bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the
     dead cops.  Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
     from his jacket.

     Bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  He
     looks at Rath.  He wants him to run.  Anyone who moves
     away from the bullet proof glass is dead.

     Both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun
     sights.

     Bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               I get out, you got me.

     Bain reaches over and closes the door.  He smiles knowing
     it is the right move.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Now what?

     Rath calmly uncocks his gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               We're both going to the airport.

     Bain nods.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               No fucking way.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Okay, don't.

     Bain thinks.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If either of us fucks around, the
               other can blow the fuel line.

     He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs.

     Bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath.

     Rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his
     gun on the fuel line.

     He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic,
     turning back towards Peterson.

     They sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit
     the expressway.  Bain can't contain himself, giddy on
     adrenaline.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Jesus -- I'm being driven to the
               airport by Robert Rath.

     He laughs.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               I can't believe this.  You rolled
               some cabby for the radio, then
               waited for an airport fare.

     He laughs again.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're
               a fucking genius.  Then you're just
               sitting there, bullshitting with me.
               Man, no way I coulda done that!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What's your name?  We both know it's
               not Nicholai.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to
               know my name.

     He leans back.  This is a big moment for him.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Bain.  Michael Bain.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               How long have you been freelance?

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Two years.  Two long fucking years.

     Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Hey.  What I don't get was why
               didn't you take the shot inside the
               restaurant?  I mean you had me, a
               free shot.  That's what I would have
               done.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty-
               forty, at best.  Not my odds.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Sounds like chickenshit --

     He laughs hard.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Listen to me calling you
               chickenshit!

     He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's
     head.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs!
               Wigs are the worst part of this job.
               I'd rather dye my hair than wear a
               wig.

     Rath studies him.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're wearing a wig now.

     Bain chokes on his laugh.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               God damn are you good.  Everyone
               says you're so fucking good.  I just
               can't believe I'm still alive.  If I
               believed in God, I'd be down on my
               knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come
               you just didn't plug us all when we
               came through the door?

     Rath does not answer.  Bain smiles.  He knows something
     about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Shit if I was you, back there --

     He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's
     head.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Game over.

     He laughs.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Do you mind if I ask you a couple of
               business questions?  You know I was
               wondering how much you bid this job
               at?

     Rath says nothing.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You don't have to tell me that.
               It's just, I know my bid was low,
               but was it too low?  I mean, did I
               seem like an amateur, like I didn't
               know what I was doing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               We both know what you were doing.

     Bain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's
     gun.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight
               inch silencer.  Classic.  When I
               first heard you used that, I
               thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.
               Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real
               clean.

     He looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Would you really blow us?

     Rath does not have to answer.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this
               has been driving me crazy for years
               -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like
               some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but
               I just got to ask you.  Everybody
               talks about how you left the Agency
               and got into the business and then
               how you went after the Russian,
               Nicholai Talinkov --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Tachlinkov.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a
               fucking genius.  They said he shaded
               you over and over.  And in the end,
               he aced you again.  Shaded and
               faded.  They say he's living on some
               Greek island, but I say that's
               fucking bullshit.  I say you're the
               best and that you planted his ass.
               Am I right?

     Rath says nothing.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               I bet I'm right.

     The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
     Cleveland airport.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus
               fucking Christ!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               After those cops, you'll never be
               able to come back to Cleveland.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Who the fuck cares about Cleveland.
               Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks
               have they got here?  Greasy mobster,
               teamster or some hand job
               politician.  I want the money marks.
               I want the marks that you get.

     A long beat of silence.

     The CAB RUMBLES up onto the "departures" ramp which
     circles past all of the terminals.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               So what happens now?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               We go around once.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Bullshit.

     He throws off his seatbelt.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You tell me that we're gonna go
               around once, then, while I'm
               checking out the lay of the land,
               you bail out and send me flying over
               the bridge.  Right?  Am I right?

     Rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the
     police and airport security.

     Rath studies the terrain.  Bain studies Rath.

     Soon they have passed the entire airport.  Rath nods.
     Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
     interchange that will bring them to the beginning.

     Bain wipes the sweat from his face.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Okay.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What?  What's okay?

     Rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               There's a sand barricade up ahead;
               I'm going to ram this cab into it.
               The cab has an airbag, odds are good
               I'll survive.  But with this steel
               casing and bullet proof glass, odds
               for you are not so good.

     Bain laughs.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Oh man, that's sweet.  That's
               fucking sweet.

     The speedometer continues to climb.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You're bluffing.

     Rath says nothing.  Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals,
     is the sand barricade.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You're fucking with me.  You want me
               to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes
               and bang -- Game over.

     The cab is flying at its target.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to
               jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm
               stuck back here until it's too late.
               Wham -- over!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I know you're going to jump.

     Bain looks at him and then at the barricade.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're still young.  Young enough to
               still think you're indestructible.
               Invincible.  You believe with utter
               certainty you can bail out at the
               last second and survive.

     The barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the
     windshield.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If you do survive, we'll see each
               other again.

     Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself
     out.

     Rath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into
     the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of
     sand as --

     Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped
     across water.

     A driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him.

     SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over
     the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag
     balloons out of the steering wheel.

     Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a
     piece of roadkill.

     The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the
     radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM.

     Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car
     stopping inches from him.  A woman jumps out, rushing to
     the front of the car, but Bain is gone.

     Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident.  One
     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  The door is
     open, the airbag popped.  Rath is gone.


<b>     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
     A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
     The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the
     windows.

     The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of
     a network television show, stacks of video monitors and
     consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic
     cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They
     snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang
     everywhere like some technological jungle.

     At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful
     athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a
     worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a
     bowl of popcorn in her lap.

     On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be
     mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an
     argument.

     What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish-
     eye lens staring down into the room.

<b>                             MAN (V.O.)
</b>               I don't give a shit what your mother
               thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your
               mother, I'm sleeping with you.

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               You won't be for long, with that
               attitude.

<b>                             MAN (V.O.)
</b>               Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god
               damned worried about your mother's
               approval, why don't you move back
               home so she can pat you on the head
               when you do something right.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Jerk.

     Jennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long
     pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very
     real.

     She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep
     herself from crying.

<b>                             MAN (V.O.)
</b>               Oh good.  Go ahead and cry.

<b>                             JENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.)
</b>               Would you please leave?

     Electra lifts her head, smelling the air.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Mmm, smell that, Nikita?

     Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across
     the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every
     corner of the chair has been clawed open.

     Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series
     of switches.

     The monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now
     looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us,
     almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking
     out a tray of chocolate chip cookies.

     Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I hope she saves some for us.

     There is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, and
     a MAN YELLING.

     Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment.

     The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone.

<b>                             MAN (V.O.)
</b>               Do you think slamming doors is going
               to help work this out?

     Electra punches a command into a keyboard.  Several of the
     screens change, showing different rooms of the same
     apartment.  Jennifer is in the bedroom, lying on the bed
     sobbing, her face buried in a pillow.

<b>                             MAN (V.O.)
</b>               I can slam doors too!

     We hear the front DOOR SLAM in the hall outside of
     Electra's apartment and through the monitor speakers.  His
     stomping FOOTSTEPS FADE as he storms down the hall and
     staircase out of the building.

     Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer.

     She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom.

     Electra reaches out; her fingers lightly touch the monitor
     screen.


<b>     INT. APARTMENT HALL
</b>
     Electra's front door opens slowly.  Timidly, she steps out
     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is
     standing in front of Jennifer's door.

     She starts to knock, but stops herself.  She isn't sure
     she should do this.

     She paces, then turns to the door.

     She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear.

     She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when
     she hears Jennifer.

<b>                             JENNIFER (O.S.)
</b>               Hello?  Ken, is that you?

     Electra panics.

     The door knob turns, the door opens and JENNIFER looks out
     into the hall.  It is empty.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT
</b>
     On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the
     phone.

<b>                             JENNIFER (V.O.)
</b>               Hi, Mom, it's me.  Ken and I just
               had a big fight.

     Electra's PAGER suddenly SOUNDS.  She shuts down the
     screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Crap.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT
</b>
     There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system;
     all of the same components, though the equipment is
     bigger, more powerful and less portable.

     On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular.
     Electra is talking on one.

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               Electra, they are not paying you to
               sit at home and watch television.

     Electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each
     has a MicroCell trademark and is labeled "Back-Up."

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I wasn't watching television.

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               The point is, they are paying for
               information.  Real information.  Not
               tooth paste brands.  Not whether he
               wads of folds his toilet paper.  And
               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.
               You are wasting everyone's time with
               this shit.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I thought it was interesting --

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               God damnit, Electra.  This is not a
               game.  This is business.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Right.  In my hands I have five
               back-up disks he made of all of his
               work last night.

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'll make my usual arrangements and
               expect my usual bonus.

<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>               Electra --

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               A pleasure doing business with you.

     She hangs up.


<b>     INT. LOBBY
</b>
     Electra comes down the stairs.

     Outside the large glass door she sees KEN, Jennifer's
     boyfriend, leaving.

     On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under
     the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan.

     Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that
     Ken is gone.

     She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
     Rath is at his computer system.

     He is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person
     that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own
     face.  It is an effort to bring himself to touch the
     keyboard, to type in his code.

     He waits.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

     Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit!

     Rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect
     himself.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm being set up.  Fucking set up!

     He looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the
     pattern completely familiar.

<b>     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
     There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches
     down, heat rising off the tarmac.


<b>     INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
     Several passengers walk through the gate into the
     terminal.

     Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport
     cafeteria, reading a folded paper.

     He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered
     to his side.

     Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph
     of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage."

     At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group
     is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously
     muscle.

     Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall.
     When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper
     and begins to follow.

     His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His
     focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to
     find Bain's.

     His hand hovers near his gun.

     Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench
     coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face.

     The man starts toward a drinking fountain.

     Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but
     he isn't sure.

     The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
     water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22.

     A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth.

     It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Sorry.  My mistake.

     Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move.


<b>     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
     The five men stride through the automated terminal doors
     and towards a waiting limousine.

     Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans,
     exits and hails a cab.

               hotel we're at, so could you just
               follow them?

<b>                             CABBY
</b>               Sure.

     Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as
     the cab pulls away.


<b>     INT. LIMOUSINE
</b>
     The five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to
<b>     RING.
</b>
     The older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase,
     removing a cellular phone.

<b>                             AKIRA
</b>               Hello?

     We hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses
     English.

<b>                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
</b>               I trust your flight was comfortable?

<b>                             AKIRA
</b>               Your Japanese is excellent.

<b>                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
</b>               Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'll call you again in twenty
               minutes.

     She punches a button and shoves the antennae down.

     The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a
     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
     wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the
     carpeted floor to the central air duct.

     The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
     coaxial run up inside the duct.

     Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations.
     She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-
     line.

     On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that
     looks exactly like the one she is in.


<b>     INT. CAB
</b>
     Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding
     traffic, the limo still in sight.

     Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded
     newspaper where he had hid the contract file.

     He flips past several documents before finding what he's
     looking for; the cat.

     He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches
     Electra rush about.

     Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
     it out.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Excuse me, your Highness.

     Nikita casually walks off the bed.

     Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
     long piece of duct-tape.


<b>     EXT. HYATT HOTEL
</b>
     The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway.

     The cab pulls in behind it.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone.


<b>     INT. HYATT LOBBY
</b>
     The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and
     uncomfortable.

     The BRIEFCASE RINGS.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra is pacing again.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Room 1414.


<b>     INT. HYATT LOBBY
</b>
     With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an
     elevator.  The doors close.

     Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators.


<b>     INT. ELEVATOR
</b>
     As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a
     familiar sound.

     Cramped in the corner is Bain.  He is PLAYING "TETRIS,"
     wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL
     into his ears.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.


<b>     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN
</b>
     At the switchboard, a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an
     operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing
     the order in the hotel computer.

<b>                             YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)
</b>               Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about
               thirty minutes.  You're welcome.

     He turns around and Rath is right behind him.


<b>     INT. ELEVATOR
</b>
     The fourteenth floor; the BELL CHIMES, the doors slide
     open and the clump of Japanese men get out.

     Just as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out.


<b>     INT. HALL
</b>
     Bain follows them down the hall, still PLAYING the GAME.
     There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on
     its prey.

     As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst
     open, a large family, heading for the pool.

     The moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and
     Bain continues down the hall again, PLAYING the GAME.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE
</b>
     When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that
     this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance
     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
     locations to display every inch of the room.  The group
     hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes.

     The four goons have their hands in their jackets.

     A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING
     SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker
     crackles.

<b>                             ELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.)
</b>               Good morning, gentlemen.  I
               apologize for the arrangement, but
               we all know those aren't business
               cards you're reaching for.  If
               anyone leaves this room, the deal's
               off.


<b>     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN
</b>
     The operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner.

     Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the
     information rolling by.

     We see that it is the previous night's room service
     receipts.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               One vegetarian plate and a can of
               tuna fish.  Room 1014.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men
     as she speaks into the microphone.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ten thousand dollars per disk.
               Insert the first disk now.

     On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the
     first disk into the laptop disk drive.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE
</b>
     Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a
     goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar
     bills, down the central air duct.

     The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies.


<b>     INT. HYATT HALL
</b>
     Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
<b>     "TETRIS."
</b>
     Suddenly, he stops.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yes!

     The display of the game reads "Game Over" and
     congratulates Bain on a new high score.

     Bain stands, smiling.  He puts the game in his pocket and
     starts down the hall.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another
     stack of money, stuffing it into her bag.

     A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up
     at the monitor.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE
</b>
     The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the
     frame is Bain.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Surprise!

     He raises his arm, his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the
     nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh, God.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE
</b>
     Another SHOT and the second bodyguard falls.  The other
     two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the
     lifeless body of his first victim.

     They FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him.

     Bain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall
     dead.  He lets his human shield fall to the ground and
     levels his gun on the shaking Akira.

<b>                             AKIRA
</b>               Don't kill me.

     Bain looks at him and smiles, then FIRES.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the
     modem.

     Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.

<b>                             BAIN (V.O.)
</b>               Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust
               anyone these days.

     He licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva.

     She stuffs the disks into her bag.  She puts Nikita in her
     "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her
     coat.

     Flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the
     letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from
     the room.


<b>     INT. HALL
</b>
     Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes.
     She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Don't be stupid and you will live.

     The elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel
     lobby ashtray.  He waves her into the elevator with his
     gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Hurry.


<b>     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY
</b>
     Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open
     street.


<b>     INT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY
</b>
     The door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the
     familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, is
     the same as Electra had left it when she ran out.

     Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's
     letter.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR
</b>
     Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the
     rear window.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Turn here.

     No one follows.  He turns back to her.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               How many bodies were there?

     He checks his watch.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He has to clean up.  How many bodies
               were there?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Um, five.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               One hour per man.

     Rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours.


<b>     INT. HYATT HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Bain has returned to room 1414.  Wearing rubber gloves, he
     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of
     rug cleaner.

     He picks up the phone for room service.

<b>                              BAIN
</b>               Hi.  This is room 1414 --

     Behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the
     Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  He is
     naked.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yes, could you send up a pot of
               coffee and my friends are going to
               need some more towels.  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large
     blood stains on the carpet.  He points the rug cleaner at
     the stain covering it with white foam.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR
</b>
     Rath sees the entrance for the expressway.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Get on the expressway.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Where are we going?

     Rath glances back.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Nowhere yet.

     Electra turns onto the highway and NIKITA HOWLS from the
     "travel kitty" in the back seat.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Nikita, hush.

     NIKITA wants out and HOWLS again.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               She won't stop unless you let her
               out.

     Rath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into
     the front seat onto Rath's lap.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Nikita?  She helped me find you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What?  How did you know I had a cat?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I
               guessed right.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Who the fuck are you?  Who do you
               work for?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I work for the government.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Yeah?

     She studies his face, his eyes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Bullshit.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You're one of them, aren't you?  A

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm part of the game, just like you.

     Electra pounds the steering wheel.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Jesus!

     He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What do you think you're doing?

     Rath plucks out the bundles of money.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Twenty large?  That's all?

<b>                             ELECTRA

</b>               The bonus on the contract for you
               was one million dollars.

     Electra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  The
     speedometer is floating around 90.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Slow down.

     He pulls out the disks.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I figure that means these are worth
               ten times that, maybe more.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ten million --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Now you understand why I'm here.

     Electra wants to scream.  The speedometer is climbing over
<b>     100.
</b>
<b>                             RATH
</b>               I really think you should slow down.


<b>     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized
     suitcases line the wall.

     Bain is sitting at the desk.  His WALKMAN is on, MUSIC
     BLASTING, as he flips casually through the telephone
     directory.

     His finger eases down a column stopping at "Morgan
     Jennifer."

     There is a KNOCK at the door.

     He smiles and tears out the page.

     There is another, LOUDER KNOCK which Bain hears this time.
     He TURN OFF the WALKMAN and opens the door; a BELLBOY is
     waiting with a luggage cart.

<b>                             BELLBOY
</b>               Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage
               you need carried.

     Bain gives him a wink and a smile.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Indeed I do.

     The red "low fuel" light is on.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Turn off the engine.

     Electra twists the ignition and the CAR DIES.  Rath
     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas
     station.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You want me to pump?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No, stay in the car.  I want you to
               understand something.  If I intended
               to kill you, you would already be
               dead.

     Electra says nothing.

     He reaches over and takes the car keys.

     When he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the
     strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think,
               breathe, think...

     Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath
     pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag.

     Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She
     appears motionless.

     The electric gas counter races like a stop watch.

     In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag.

     The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around
     the car and heads for the station.

     Electra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her
     tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire
     stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a
     tangled handful of wire.

     She looks up; Rath is inside paying.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

     Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping,
     stripping, twisting.

     Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking
     for him.  It takes only a second for him to realize what
     she is doing.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Oh shit.

     He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
     strikes them; the BATTERY GRINDS.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Please, please.

     He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES.  She stomps on
     the gas, ramming the shift into drive.

     TIRES SQUEALING, the car swerves forward as Rath slams
     into it.  He bounces backward, falling to the ground.

     The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one
     knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  He draws a bead,
     but, he does not shoot.

     With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.

<b>                             RATH

     Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is
     Jennifer Morgan.  What she was hoping for is not there.
     She looks up and sees Electra.

<b>                             JENNIFER
</b>               Excuse me --

     Electra stops.

<b>                             JENNIFER
</b>               You live here, don't you?

     Electra nods.

<b>                             JENNIFER
</b>               I'm sorry, this may sound really
               weird, but my friend told me he
               slipped a letter under the door here
               and I was wondering if you happened
               to see it?

     Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Letter?

<b>                             JENNIFER
</b>               Yeah.  He said he saw a woman with
               dark hair going into the building
               when he dropped it off.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               No.  I don't have it.

     Electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  Jennifer is
     bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.

<b>                             JENNIFER
</b>               I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to -- I'm
               sorry.

     She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra
     in the lobby.

     Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to
     pocket.

     A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is
     gone.

     She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the
     stairs.


<b>     INT. STAIRCASE
</b>
     Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the
     possibilities, filled with fear.

     By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is
     entering her apartment.

     Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
     Electra flies across the living room to the monitors.

     She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel.

     On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking
     her phone messages.  One from her mother.

     Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire
     apartment is in front of her.

     On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the
     oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room.

     Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath.

     Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out.
     Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just
     been.

     Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that
     she had dropped on the table and sorts through it.

     Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference
     to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though
     he knew she couldn't see him.

     He moves into a room, just as she moves out.

     Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is
     unable to turn away.

     Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts
     undressing for her bath.

     He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom.
     If Jennifer would turn around she would see him.

     Electra is about to run, to call out when --

     Something catches Bain's eye.

     He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is
     looking straight up into the camera.

     He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber
     optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over
     the bed.

     Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra.

     Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he
     moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his
     finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches
     across his face as he whispers --

<b>                             BAIN (V.O.)
</b>               Oh, you sick little bitch --

     Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of
     her.

     She rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them
     into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks
     important.  She grabs Nikita in the "travel kitty."


<b>     EXT. BACK PORCH
</b>
     The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind
     her as --

     Bain turns from the back stairs.

     She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO
     HOLES in the door.


<b>     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT
</b>
     She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase,
     still clutching the "travel kitty," as --

     The back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging,
     FIRING his GUN.

     BULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the
     front door into the hall.


<b>     INT. HALL
</b>
     The stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway,
     when --

     Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked.

     Electra drops to the floor as --

     Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment.

     Rath FIRES.

     The wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain.
     Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment.

     Rath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra.

     They run down the stairs.


<b>     EXT. REAR STAIRCASE
</b>
     Bain leaps down the flights.


<b>     EXT. ALLEY
</b>
     Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction.
     They are gone.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Fuck me!


<b>     EXT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Somewhere in the city.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both
     immediately alone.

     She walks across the room to a chair in the corner,
     curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her
     lap.

     He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
     the room and sits.

     They watch each other.  Silence.

     Between then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good
     idea when he sees one.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Want a drink?

     Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's.

     He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down.
     Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Okay...

     He returns to his table with his drink.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm not good at this sort of thing,
               but we don't have a lot of time, so
               I'll just go ahead and get started.
               First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is
               she thinking?'

     Her body tightens, coils.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost
               been killed twice and now she is
               alone in a room with a man that she
               believes is an... assassin.

     Another deep pull on the bourbon.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Furthermore she was brought here not
               entirely on her own accord which
               only increases her fear and
               suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is
               afraid, her first, maybe her only
               thought will be escape.  Does that
               leave me any other option?

     He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping
     out his gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

     Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it
     to her.  She looks at it.  Back at him.

     He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks
     to the bar.

     She picks up the gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The gun is silenced.  She could
               shoot me right now.

     She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               She could take the car and be far
               from here before the maid comes in
               the morning, but --

     She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS; the LAMP EXPLODES, the
     CHAIRS around him ERUPT, tufts of white stuffing leaping
     into the air.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Shut up!

     He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Stop trying to tell me what I'm
               thinking!

     She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'll tell you what you're thinking
               -- you think I'm not going to shoot
               you but right now you're not so
               sure, are you?

     A slight shake of the head, no.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You're thinking that maybe it was a
               mistake to give me this gun, that
               maybe I'm not going to think about
               things logically because I'm a woman
               and I'm freaked out and I'm going to
               do something impulsive and
               irrational -- right?

     She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head.  He's
     surprised to be alive.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You don't know shit about me!  Now
               sit down!

     He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
     she had worn sitting a moment ago.

     She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
     of liquor.  She sucks it all down and throws the bottle
     across the room.

     Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Okay.  How did you find me?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're the computer hacker, you tell
               me.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You didn't know anything about me.

     Nikita rubs up against her leg.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Nikita?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian.
               There aren't that many.

     She nods, slurping at her bottle.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You're one of them, aren't you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               'Them'?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               An assassin?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Until a minute ago.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What does that mean?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If I still was what I used to be,
               you would not be pointing that at
               me.

     Electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Who is that other guy?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Another contractor.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Someone hired both of you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  They hired Bain.  The contract
               would have been mine, but Bain took
               it from me as he took the previous
               one.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               So this is something between you and
               him?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He stole the contract knowing that
               I would come after him.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because he is trying to retire me.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He wants to kill you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The nature of the business.  You
               remove your competition.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               And you want to use me to get him?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Forget it!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               We don't have a choice.

     She FIRES the GUN, pocking the wall behind him.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Right.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'm two seconds away from making my
               choice which means you've got two
               seconds to tell me why I shouldn't
               shoot you.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's simple.  You need me.  I need
               you.  And we will both need money.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I don't need you to get the money --
               my money!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If it hadn't been for me, you would
               be dead.

     She's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I don't need the money.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               This is something that is never
               going to end.  You can never work in
               the business again with this
               contract, because he will find you.
               To survive, you have to go into deep
               hiding.  And that's going to take
               money, a lot of money.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Then you can have the disks and I'll
               just walk out that door --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If you walk out that door, Bain will
               still come after you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because he took a contract on you.
               He'll come for you and he'll find
               you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You don't know that -- you're trying
               to scare me.
<b>     
</b><b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  It's the truth.  I know what
               you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're
               a ghost, you're not part of the real
               world.  You don't have a social
               security number.  You don't pay
               taxes.  You've probably used ten
               different names over the last ten
               years.  A long time ago something
               probably happened, something illegal
               and you ran, you disappeared and it
               was easy.  You think you can do it
               again.  But I'm telling you, fading
               from the law is nothing.  No matter
               what you do, where you go, I swear
               to you that Bain will find you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               How?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Right now, as we sit here, he is
               tearing through your apartment.  He
               is digging through your drawers,
               emptying your closets.  He will take
               your telephone and address books,
               your appointment books.  If you keep
               a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go
               into the kitchen and find out what
               kind of food you eat, liquor you
               drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the
               bathroom he will find any
               prescription drugs you take and
               where you get them filled.  If you
               have video tape or recordings he
               will watch and listen to all of
               them.

     She is coming unglued.  Imagining him watching her tapes,
     going through her possessions.  She is moving, pacing,
     ready to explode.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh Jesus Jesus...

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He will know everything about you.
               Everything.  I know, because I've
               done it.  Once you've been inside a
               mark's home, you're in their head.
               If you're any good, you'll find the
               mark in a week, and Bain is good
               because I was the best and I
               couldn't take him.

     She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it
     everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in
     WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.

     When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels
     the gun at him.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Shut up!  All right!  You've said
               enough!

     She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample
     bottles.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I need to think... To be alone.

     With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following
     at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the
     door.


<b>     INT. BATHROOM
</b>
     She locks the door and then collapses.  Her body seems to
     fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the GUN
     and the BOTTLES falling from her arms, CLATTERING SOFTLY
     on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands.


<b>     INT. BEDROOM
</b>
     Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board,
     putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a
     ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance.

     From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra
<b>     CRYING.
</b>

<b>     INT. BATHROOM
</b>
     With her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is
     sobbing, her body rocking.  The crying seems very similar
     to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release.


<b>     INT. BEDROOM
</b>
     Rath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He
     stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but
     stops himself.

     Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he
     just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to
     his chess game.


<b>     INT. BATHROOM
</b>
     Her eyes are now burning red.  She stops crying long
     enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch.  Nikita
     rubs against her and she strokes her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh shit, Nikita.


<b>     INT. BEDROOM
</b>
     Rath is setting up his computer system.  He hears the TUB
<b>     FILLING UP.
</b>

<b>     INT. BATHROOM
</b>
     Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Cheers.

     Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor
     where we see that many of the bottles are now empty.

     In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a
     wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the
     water.


<b>     INT. BEDROOM
</b>
     When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at
     his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets
     the gun on the table between them.

     Rath looks up at her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Listen -- I don't even know your
               name.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Rath.  Robert Rath.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Electra.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Just Electra?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               As in daughter of Agamemnon?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               No.  Just Electra.

     The conversation dies.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What I'm trying to say is that --
               I'm not sure I can do this, help
               you, unless I know more about you.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What do you want to know?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               If Bain hadn't taken the contract on
               me, would you have?

     He stares at her.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because I'm done.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               This is crazy.  I can't trust you.
               You can't trust me.  How can we
               possibly help each other?

     They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying
     between them.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Do you play?

     She looks at the chess board.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               With computers.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's not the same, is it?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Better than playing with yourself.

     He smiles.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I had an opponent.

     She understands that he is trying to tell her something.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Had?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He was Russian.  Nicholai
               Tachlinkov.  A legend in the
               business when I was just starting.
               I admired him.  When I heard he
               loved chess I became obsessed with
               the game.

     Electra studies the board.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He was white?

     Rath nods.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               It looks like white's game.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               We played with a code using <u>The New</u>
               <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three
               years we played twelve matches.  I
               never won.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why didn't you finish this game?

     She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a
     Bishop.  Rath counters, taking her Knight.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He was... taken.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He was killed.

     Rath nods.

     Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
     out the chess game.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               By who?

     A long beat.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I killed him.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because that's how it works.  That's
               what it's about.  He was the best.
               He was on top.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Where you wanted to be?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.  As soon as you get into this
               business, all you can think about is
               getting to the top.  That's all
               there is.  Until then, there is
               nothing.  You are nothing.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               How did you get into the business?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The same way everyone does; the
               government, the Agency.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               The C.I.A.?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               More or less.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               How old were you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               They recruited me when I was in high
               school.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Jesus -- why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Languages.  I was already fluent in
               nine languages.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You were like a boy genius?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Some people said that.  I never
               thought so.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why not?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I was just different.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You went from high school to the
               Agency?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  I graduated from George
               Washington University.  Then I
               entered the Agency training program.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               They didn't give you a choice, did
               they?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No, they didn't.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               But you knew what they were training
               you for?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Of course.  I was going to be James
               Bond.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ahhhh...

<b>                             RATH
</b>               They are very good at what they do.
               It's very seductive.  The training,
               the weapons, the travel --

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               The exotic women.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Women?  No... not really.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why not?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Women... I don't... I don't want to
               talk about women.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because you are a women.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why did you leave the Agency?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The same reason everyone does.  You
               hear your name on C-SPAN and you
               realize you're a skeleton in
               someone's closet and they're coming
               to bury you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               They tried to kill you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.  It didn't matter much to them
               as long as I disappeared.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Then you went freelance?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The only thing different about the
               private sector is that a General
               Contractor takes less of a
               percentage than the government, so
               you make more money.  Then once you
               make the transition, you realize you
               were never working for the
               government; it was always the
               private sector, the vested interests
               and it's the same vested interests
               that continue to buy your plane
               tickets.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Tell me about the first time.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               My first take?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Because I want to know.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It was... mechanical.  Very precise.
               It was exactly like the training
               drill except for the adrenaline.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Are they usually like that?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  Just the first one.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               After that?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               They become complicated... messy.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Did it ever bother you?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Did it ever bother James Bond?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That's fiction.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               This is fiction!  Don't you see
               that?  This is another reality.  And
               the people that come into the world
               to play this game -- nobody forces
               them!  They're here, they know the
               rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do
               you understand what I am saying?  No
               one is innocent -- including you!

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Does that mean it didn't bother you?

     Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You get a job swinging a hammer, the
               first day you get a blister, it
               tears open, it bleeds and it stays
               sore a long time.  You keep swinging
               the hammer, you get a good hard
               callous that covers that spot and it
               never bothers you again.

     Electra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook
     into her back row.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Check.

     He leans back.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Is that what you wanted to hear?
               Something cold blooded... something
               remorseless...

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               No.  Something honest.

     A beat.  Rath likes this woman.

     She moves her Queen.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Mate.

     He smiles.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I hope your plan is better than your
               game.


<b>     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     The room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and
     polyester patterned curtains.

     We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE
     ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is
     held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the
     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
     naked circuit boards.

     It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been
     put together with a fraction of the resources.

     Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside
     the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of
     Doritos and his Gameboy.

     On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel
     is his cleaned gun.

     Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down
     his beer.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Where have you been, Michael?

     He belches.

     He is communicating with his General Contractor.

     On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of
     it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house.

     Bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  He smiles as he
     smells them.

<b>                             BAIN

</b>               I've learned from MicroCell, Rath

     Bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  He runs his hands
     through his sweaty hair.

<b>     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
     Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section,
     which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping
     champagne.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               God, I love first class.  I remember
               when I was a little girl, I would
               wonder what it was like up here.  I
               would always try to peek through the
               curtains.

     Rath says nothing, staring out the window.

     Electra shakes her head.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I hope Nikita's all right.

<b>                             RATH

     Electra sips the last of her champagne.

<b>     EXT. TERMINAL CAB STAND

     Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them
     in his trunk.


<b>     INT. CAB
</b>
     Rath speaks perfect Spanish.

<b>                             RATH
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               Good afternoon.  We have
               reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in
               Costa Blanca.

<b>                             CABBY
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               Yes, sir.
<b>     
</b>
<b>     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY
</b>
     The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass
     hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
     gulf water.

     Rath is upset.

<b>                             RATH
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

<b>                             CABBY
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

<b>                             RATH
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the
               city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.

<b>                             CABBY
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there
               was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.
               This is the new Hotel Paraiso.

<b>                             RATH
</b>                       (in Spanish)
               Take us there.


<b>     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - DAY
</b>
     American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but
     much of the out-lying city is very poor.

     The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  The
     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
     in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of
     the building rather than the building itself.

     Rath stares at it, remembering.

     Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza
     del Sol.

     He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly
     opposite of that.

     The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful
     old building; its exterior walls are white-washed
     concrete, blindingly bright white.

     Electra looks at the bank and smiles.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               So, that's where all that S &amp; L
               money is?

     Rath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He
     turns back to the fourth story window.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               That's where he'll be.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I wasn't expecting this.  I need to
               think.


<b>     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT
</b>
     Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
     midnight oil.


<b>     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR
</b>
     On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
     like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling
     as though they are alone.

     Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator.
     It is a strange contrast.

     Electra is staring at them.

     Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world.

     The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens.

     Nobody moves.

     The DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone
     realizes that this is their floor.

     Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back
     open.

     It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and
     smiles politely, on the way out.


<b>     INT. HALL
</b>
     The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding their
     door first.

     Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters.

     Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as he
     fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his legs
     and over his ass.

     He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him
     inside.

     Electra softly closes her door.


<b>     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
     balcony doors at the dark gulf water.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Did you see them?

     Electra moves about the large suite.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               They looked like they were in love.

     Rath says nothing.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Well, I think I'll take a bath.
               Come on, Nikita!

     The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to
     himself.


<b>     INT. BATHROOM
</b>
     Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water
     running through her fingers as she adjusts the
     temperature.

     After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH, a GLASS BREAKING.
     It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES, a WOMAN GIGGLING
     and a THUMPING.  The sounds are coming from the other side
     of the tub wall, from the other suite.  Electra puts her
     ear against the tile to listen.

     The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear.
     She turns it OFF.

     There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING and
     then, the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS.

     Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving
     up toward the over-head fan and ducts.

     The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents,
     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub,
     listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE
<b>     MAKING LOVE.
</b>
     Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles.


<b>     INT. BEDROOM
</b>
     It is dark now.  A single desk light is on, under which
     Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in
     their familiar pattern.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom.  She seems very clean
     and fresh, wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That felt great.  You should try it.

     She watches him setting the pieces onto the board.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Don't you ever get tired of playing
               the same game?

     He looks at her.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why not?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It helps me to focus.  It centers
               me, helps me think.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh.  What do you think about?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Work.  The things I need to get
               done.

     She sits across from him looking at the board.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Do you think about the game?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               But you've never figured out a way
               to win.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Not even a stalemate?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What happens if you do?

     This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is
     suddenly annoyed by her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Can I ask you something?

     He knows she will anyway.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What will you do if this works, if
               we get the money?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I don't know... maybe I'll live on a
               boat, sail to all the places I've
               never been.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That sounds nice.

     He finishes his glass of bourbon.

     She is not sure what to say next, if she should say
     anything at all.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like
               to try and get some sleep.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You can have the bed.  The chair is
               fine for me.

     He pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from
     the ice bucket.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Thanks.

     She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets.

     Rath sits across the room, his back to her.

     She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Do you think he's here?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Here?

<b>                             ELECTRA

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

     She thinks.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What do you think he's doing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I don't know... But I'm sure he's
               not sleeping.

     She pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  Her eyes do not
     close.


<b>     INT. HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT
</b>
     A small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built
     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning.

     Bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage
     jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder.  His
     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
     his ears.

     He is tearing open a long box wrapped in "Happy Birthday"
     paper.

     Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.
     He smiles.

     He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with
     automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he
     jumps up.

     In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the
     gun.

     Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself
     again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the
     gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning
     it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips
     and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.

     The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the
     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is
     sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You're dead, motherfucker.


<b>     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY
</b>
     Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the
     warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.

     Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Breakfast.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why don't you bring it out here?
               It's beautiful out here.

     Rath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either
     side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out
     and sees another hotel with windows facing them.

     He turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     The breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee,
     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach.

     He stops working.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I know what you are thinking.  I'm
               not going to disappear, okay?  I'm
               not going anywhere, just down there,
               to that beautiful beach.  I got to
               get out of this room, just for a
               little while.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Okay.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Really?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He won't be looking for you.  Just
               be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your
               sunglasses on.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.


<b>     INT. HOTEL HALL
</b>
     Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach.
     At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get
     on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it
     for her, but she stops herself.

     The elevator closes.

     She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door
     to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her
     fingers.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Rath is still at the table.

     The curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing
     through the open patio door.  They swell open and fall.
     It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in
     the changing shape of the curtain.

     Rath stands.  He walks to the open door.  Standing in the
     frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below.

     He slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY
</b>
     Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of
     the plaza.  His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.

     He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
     plaza.

     He looks at the bank, at the military-style security
     guards that patrol the front.

     He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze
     falling on the tall, burned-out building.

     He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.

     He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down
     his chin.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Rath is leaning back in the bed, NIKITA PURRING in his
     lap.

     He did not sleep last night and is very tired.  His eyes
     fight to stay open.

     The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hotel
     room as he sleeps.  The program is a SPANISH DUBBED
     version of GOLDFINGER.

     The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun
     flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking
     Electra.

     Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK
     back into place.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You should knock.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Sorry.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               How was the beach?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               The beach?  It was nice.

     She smiles.


<b>     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DUSK
</b>
     The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
     of the hotel.


<b>     INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall.
     In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
     looking over the top of, staring intensely across the
     room.

     We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even.  He is
     doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  His body is
     coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he
     moves fluidly through space.

     Electra begins to breath with him.

     She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to
     meet his.

     He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his
     eyes closed, rested.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That was beautiful.

     He looks at her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Tai Chi, right?

     He nods.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Where did you learn it?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Taiwan.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Not that I would know, but you look
               like you're really good at it.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Thank you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I've always wanted to learn
               something like that.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You should.  It's very important,
               that the body release the energy
               that builds in it.

     Electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of
     clothes.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm going to shower.  If you're
               hungry, go ahead and order some
               dinner.

     Electra nods again.


<b>     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Bain is doing push ups.  He is naked except for his
     camouflage bikinis.

     He has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip
     deeper.

     His body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red.

     He is like a piston firing up and down.  The muscles in
     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.

     Slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his
     knotting and twisting expression.

     Half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair.

     He rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep.  It hurts.  He
     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles.


<b>     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Rath checks his watch.  It's after eight o'clock.  He
     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm going to call.

     Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed.

     He dials, types the code and waits.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Hello, Robert.

<b>                             RATH/SCREEN
</b>               The contract?

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Paid in full.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Transferred to the specified
               account.

     Rath stares at the screen.

<b>                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
</b>               Goodbye, Robert.

     Rath disconnects.  The PHONE HUMS.

     Electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Sit down.

     She does.

     He opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens
     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Okay --

     He starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra
     picks up the mike.  She looks over it, frowns.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Two way?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Transmits and receives.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Cheap as shit.

     He looks at her.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I paid a lot for these.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               They saw you coming a mile away.  If
               I had known we'd be using --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have
               to deal with these.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Fine.

     He goes back to his drawing.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               This is the bank.  This is the
               hotel.  In the morning I will enter
               the bank.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Check.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He will be hidden somewhere out
               here, probably somewhere low, in the
               crowd.  He'll stay there until he
               sees me enter the bank.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               But he won't shoot you right then?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  It would be amateur.  A risk.
               He'll wait for the prime shot, that
               he knows is coming.  Once I'm
               inside, he'll move to the hotel.
               He'll go up the back, too much
               traffic in the front.

     He draws another square.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A
               public place far enough away that he
               won't notice you, but with a good
               enough view you'll be able to see
               him when he moves inside.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Okay.  Then what?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Then, we wait.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know
               if I like this plan.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It will take the entire day, but he
               will begin to doubt himself.  He
               will begin to believe that he missed
               me, that somehow I slipped by and am
               already on a plane to Europe.

     He describes this as though remembering it.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The sun will be low, almost dark,
               the air cool and the bank will
               almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He
               will put the rifle down, he will get
               up and he will walk across the plaza
               to the bank.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why won't he wait until the bank
               closes?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He won't be able to.  He'll have to
               go inside.  He'll have to see with
               his own eyes, whether or not I am
               there.  If the bank closes, he won't
               know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm
               sure.  And when he does you'll go
               into the hotel, go upstairs and take
               the gun.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What?  What if he brings it with
               him?

     He shakes his head.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He can't.  The bank has an expensive
               security system; metal detectors and
               X-ray machines.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That means you won't have a gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               That's right.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               And with the mikes, I'll tell you
               when he leaves the hotel and you'll
               tell me when he leaves the bank.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               If things go well, I don't have to.
               You'll already be in a rented car
               waiting for me.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You'll have the money.  How do I
               know that you won't --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'll be walking out of the bank,
               unarmed.  You'll have the gun and
               I'll drive the car.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               We split the money?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Five million apiece.  You get on
               your plane, I get on mine.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Sounds pretty well figured out.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I've been thinking about it for a
               long time.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Except --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Except, if he doesn't come out of
               the hotel.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I told you, he will.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You can't know for sure, how can
               you?  I mean, you're not him.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I was.

     She waits for him to explain.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Ten years ago, I sat there in that
               same hotel window, sweat pouring off
               of me waiting --

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               For Nicholai?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You killed him here?  In this city,
               outside that bank?

     Rath nods.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What is it?  I don't like this at
               all.  What is going on here?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I don't know.  It just happened.  I
               was here ten years ago, I'm here
               now.  That's it.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I don't believe that.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It wasn't planned or premeditated.
               I swear.  Things happened beyond my
               control.  I understood; I saw where
               they were leading and I suppose that
               it just made sense.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ten years ago.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What happened?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I waited until I was insane and then
               I walked into the bank.  He was
               sitting there, very calm, waiting
               for me.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What did he want?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He wanted what I want now; to get
               out of the business.  To disappear
               to some empty Greek island.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What did he say?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               He said I couldn't win.  That no one
               wins at this game.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Was that it?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Then he offered me one million
               dollars to walk away, to quit the
               business.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               You didn't take it.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  I went back to the hotel.  And
               waited.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ten years later, here you are again.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.  Here I am again.


<b>     POV - THROUGH TELESCOPIC LENS - MARBLE STATUE
</b>
     The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the
     head of a marble statue.


<b>     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Bain is laying on the floor in the dark.  The rifle is
     under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street
     at the statue.

     He looks up from the scope, checking the street.  It is
     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight.

     His finger squeezes, the GUN ALMOST SILENT, as --

<b>     INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>     STATUE
</b>
     A chunk of STONE EXPLODES out the head of the statue.
     Again, the GUN SPITS and another cloud of dust and ROCK
     BURSTS from the head.  His finger is pumping the trigger,
     until the head cracks and falls.

     He's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the
     headless statue.

     He rolls onto his side still laughing.  Then, suddenly, he
     stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky.


<b>     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in
     another world.

     Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               This has been the longest day of my
               life.

     Rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  Electra looks at the
     drink, downs the whole glass.  He refills it.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Do you have ulcers?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I think I got one today.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Five million dollars will buy a lot
               of Rolaids.

     She smiles.  They both gulp down their drinks and he fills
     them again.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What do you suppose he's doing now?

     Rath shrugs.  He is no longer looking at her; staring at
     the board, moving his mind into the chess game.

     She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the
     way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want
     to be left alone right now.

     She reaches over and moves a white knight.

     He blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities.

     He picks a bishop and counters.

     After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes
     his knight.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why did you trade a bishop for a
               knight?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I
               like knights.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               They're worth less points.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               So?

     There is no point in arguing.

     As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the
     distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very
     vigorous LOVE.

     Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no
     sign of it, concentrating on the game.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Do you hear them?

     He looks up.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Listen.

     He hears it.  Not interested.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Did you think they were newlyweds?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I didn't notice them.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               When I first saw them I thought they
               were married.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               How do you know they're not?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I went into their room this
               afternoon.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               It was no big deal.  I saw them
               leave, I went in.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Jesus, if someone had --

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Nobody ever sees me.   

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why in the hell would you take that
               chance?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I heard them last night and it made
               me want to know something about
               them.  I wanted to, so I did.

     Rath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST
<b>     SCREAMING.
</b>
<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               She is married, but not to him.
               Another man, much older.  She has
               four kids.  The young guy works for
               her.  And I think she likes kinky
               sex.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Thank you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Isn't it interesting though?  I
               mean, look at us, in this room.  Or
               yesterday, when we were walking in
               the plaza market.  I mean, we look
               like just another couple.  But what
               are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               No?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's always been that way.  The
               world has always functioned on two
               levels.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I know.  It makes me crazy.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I don't know.  When I was in
               college, I was forced to go to a
               psychiatrist because I was caught
               drilling holes in my dorm room
               floor.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               And you were drilling these
               holes...?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               So I could watch the girl that lived
               under me.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Apparently this doctor was unable to
               cure you.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He told me that my curiosity became
               unnaturally entangled with my sense
               of self-preservation.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Did he explain how this happened?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He believed it all went back to one
               night, when as a little girl.  I
               watched my parents have this big
               fight, really big.  I thought my
               mother was going to kill my father.
               Then they went into their room and
               made up.  And I watched them make
               love through the keyhole.

     The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX.

     Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               That's a ridiculous move.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Because, I'll take it.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'm playing white, remember.  You
               can't tell me which pieces to move.
               It doesn't work that way.

     He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Can I ask you something?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm sure you will.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Am I attractive?

     This gets his attention.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Are you attracted to me?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Why?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why?  I don't know.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Is it a physical thing, or a mental
               thing?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Both.

     A good answer.  Electra smiles.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Is that why you didn't want to talk
               about women before?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I didn't want to complicate the
               situation.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Attraction is a complication?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It can be.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               It happened to you before?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Who was she?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Someone like me, like you.  A pro.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               What happened to her?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               She was taken.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Did you --

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.  I tried to stop it.  I
               couldn't.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Was she the only one?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               After her, I realized that to
               survive I had to live without...
               It's dangerous to let things become
               complicated.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Is this becoming complicated?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm not sure that I care anymore.

     He looks up from the game.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Were you attracted to me right away?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               No.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               When did it start?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Honestly?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Uh-huh.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               When I gave you my gun and you
               almost shot me.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why?

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               That doesn't sound normal.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I'm not normal.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I know.  That's why I'm attracted to
               you.  I mean, you make me nervous.
               You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my
               curiosity/self-preservation thing,
               but all I can really think about
               right now is kissing you.

     They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the
     chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor.

     They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry,
     aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at
     their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as
     they become naked in front of each other.  There is
     nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very
     real.

     He takes her, lifting her onto the table.

     She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out
     of the way.

     She opens her legs and he moves in between them.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I wanted to tell you --

     Her breath rushes out, then back in.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               My real name is Anna.

     He smiles.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Martin.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Martin.

     Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into
     her.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Nice to meet you, Martin.


<b>     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT
</b>
     Outside of the room, we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO
<b>     PEOPLE MAKING LOVE.
</b>

<b>     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT
</b>
     We are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old
     flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot.

     On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head.

<b>     CLOSER
</b>
     We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes,
     which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king.

<b>     CLOSER
</b>
     We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye.

<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

<b>     WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT
</b>
     We PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares,
     black and white like a chess board.

     A woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past.

     RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.  A man crosses
     behind her, in another direction.

     HIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the
     black and white marble floor of the --


<b>     INT. INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY
</b>
     It is a strange and beautiful bank.

     The ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate,
     baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble
     a sun.

     It looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its
     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important
     Mexican figures.

     Already it is crowded, people and security guards moving
     about beneath us.

     Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers.


<b>     EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE
</b>
     The cafe is off the plaza.

     Electra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can
     see the back of the burned-out hotel.

     She hears Rath in her ear-piece.

<b>                             RATH (V.O.)
</b>               All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll
               move now.  How are you doing?

     She is nervous.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               I'm ready.

<b>                             RATH

     Rath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark
     sunglasses.  In his hand is a very large briefcase.  He
     crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows.

<b>                             TELLER

<b>                             TELLER

<b>     EXT. CAFE
</b>
     Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name
     "Martin."


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     A BANK OFFICIAL walks over to the window, carrying a
     printed receipt, with a very bright smile.

<b>                             OFFICIAL
</b>               Senor Rath, we have received your
               transfer.

     He hands Rath the receipt.  He glances at it, checking the
     zeros.  There are seven of them.

<b>                             RATH

     The smile fades.

<b>     EXT. CAFE
</b>
     Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving
     down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the
     menacing indifference of a shark.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish, when
     Electra whispers in Rath's ear.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He's here.

     Rath freezes.


<b>     EXT. CAFE
</b>
     Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall,
     covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out
     of the burned hotel.  He is carrying a long nylon duffel
     bag.

     At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled
     loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               He's inside.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs
     set in pairs along the wall of the bank.

     He glances at the enormous clock, which reads 10:10.  He
     checks his Rolex.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Now, we wait.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL PARAISO
</b>
     The center of the hotel is open.  Interior hall balconies,
     which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium
     courtyard.  The fire did the most damage here, spreading
     easily throughout the entire building.

     The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has
     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
     floors and walls.

     Bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred
     staircase to the fifth floor.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     The room has been heavily burned, stained black from
     smoke.  The charred carpet crunches and cracks, as Bain
     walks across it to the window.

     As he nears the exterior wall, several FLOOR BOARDS BREAK
     with a brittle SNAP and he almost falls through.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Shit.

     He pulls his leg free.

     Outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a
     perfect site.

     Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun.

     He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place.

     He aims down at the bank's bright white stairs.  A man is
     walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his
     forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope.

     Bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head
     bursting open.

     He giggles.

     Leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window,
     the gun in his lap, he waits.

     Time slows to a crawl.

     Without taking his eye from the bank, Bain rummages
     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes.  He pulls
     one out with his lips and lights it.

     Taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
     drift up into the night.

<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>     SUN
</b>
     White hot.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
     window sill, where Bain extinguishes another.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What in the fuck are you doing in
               there?

     The room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front.
     It is difficult to breathe.

     A man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to
     Rath's.  Bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled.

     He sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the
     trigger, but he is not sure it is Rath.

     He looks over the scope, looks back.  The man reaches the
     bottom of the stairs.  Bain's body sags.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               That's not him.  Jesus, Bain, baby,
               chill the fuck out.

     He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
     forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood.

     He again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of
     bottled water.  He chugs the whole thing.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers to
     sign.

<b>                             OFFICIAL
</b>               Your signature, senor.  Everything
               is ready.

     Rath signs them, but does not get up.

<b>                             OFFICIAL
</b>               Excellent, senor.  If you could
               follow me?

               associate.  Can you hold everything
               for me until he arrives?

<b>                             OFFICIAL

<b>     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought
     of all that money.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Ten million dollars, sitting there.
               Waiting... this is insane.


<b>     INT. BANK

     There is a faint smile on Rath's lips.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     The shadows are getting longer.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     Bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his
     teeth.  He has to urinate.  Bad.

     He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with
     the scope.  Still nothing.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               This is fucking insane.

     He grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and
     begins refilling it.

     A man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the
     bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  It is not Rath.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Fucking God dammit!

     He hurls the bottle of piss across the room.


<b>     INT. BANK

     The sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20.
     After a long beat a single minute clicks off.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM
</b>
     The sun is getting low.  The room much darker now.

     Bain sits at the window; his body a knot.

     A large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's
     eyes light up.  One by one, the scope passes over each
     face.

     They trickle down the steps and into the plaza.

     The stairs are again empty.

     Bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting
     open the floor.

     He looks at the bank.  Nothing.  He checks his watch.  In
     fifteen minutes the bank will close.

     He stands up.


<b>     EXT. CAFE
</b>
     Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain
     emerges from the shadows.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh my God.

     He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't
     get out of his way.

<b>                             ELECTRA

<b>                             ELECTRA

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yes.

     She sees Bain storming up the stairs.  She stands, tosses
     several bills on the table and leaves.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     Bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses,
     scanning the room.  His face is a twisted grimace,
     streaked with black charcoal.  His body and clothes are
     covered in sweat and large salt rings.  His breathing
     labored.

     He sees Rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even
     wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him.

     His first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops
     himself.  He is confused, unsure.

     Then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts
     his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath, BOOTS
     CLICKING against the polished MARBLE.

     Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               How'd you know?  Just tell me that.
               How'd you fucking know?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               I knew the same way in ten years
               you're going to know.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               What does that fucking mean?

<b>                             RATH
</b>               It means that I'm going to tell you
               things, even though I already know
               that you're not going to listen to a
               God damned thing I say.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then
     navigates around a large hole, towards the last room.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
<b>                             RATH
</b>               It's irony.  That's what it is.  But
               the real irony is that you won't
               know it's irony until you're sitting
               over here.

     Bain isn't listening.  Instead he's watching, everyone who
     walks near them.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               When you walked in here and you saw
               me, sitting here, waiting; the first
               thing that went through your head
               was that you were a dead man.

     This catches Bain's ear.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               You're thinking that you've been
               sold out.  That's the only way I
               could know you were out there.  Why
               would you think this?  Because you
               don't trust your contractor.  You
               don't trust anyone.  It's automatic.
               It's the first and last commandment.
               It's the only thing that keeps you
               alive.  So, try as I might to tell
               you the truth, you can't believe me.
               Do you see the irony of the
               situation?  It's kind of funny,
               isn't it?

     Bain is not laughing.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon
     duffel bag.

     Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman,
     his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier of
     Fortune and a Punisher comic book.

     The rifle is not here.


<b>     INT. BANK

<b>                             RATH

               where I was going to pick up the
               transferred money from MicroCell.
               You don't know how they got the
               information.  It bothered you, but
               you didn't care.  How do I know
               this?  Because ten years ago, I was
               sitting in that chair, as scared
               shitless as you are now.

<b>                             RATH

               hate the fact that your hand is
               shaking and mine isn't.  That you're
               sweating your balls off and I'm not.
               You've got fear and hate in your
               belly like battery acid, all because
               of me.

<b>                             BAIN

</b>               All right, Bain.  Pay attention,
               because this is where everything
               changes.

     Electra is beginning to panic.  She cannot find the gun
     and has started looking in other rooms.

     slipping out of him.

     They stare at each other.

<b>                             BAIN

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You don't know a fucking thing about
               me.  You don't have the slightest
               fucking clue.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Why don't you tell me.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               I'll tell you this.  After
               Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to
               be alive.  But now, here, I just
               realized that you were the lucky
               one.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Now I'll tell you something.  It
               wouldn't fucking matter if I offered
               you one hundred million dollars.
               You'd still be thinking the same
               thing, that you're going to take me.
               And here I am, sitting through this,
               knowing it's bullshit, looking at
               you and the only thing going on in
               my mind, the only thing I can think
               is that, in just a few minutes I'm
               going to take you.

     Bain jumps out of the seat.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yeah, okay!  I'm ready!  Let's
               fucking go!

     He's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone.
     He's out the door.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for
     the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the
     hotel.

     In her ear she hears Rath.

<b>                             RATH (V.O.)
</b>               Electra?

     She shrieks.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     Rath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly
     stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the
     case.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra?


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra is frantic.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               God, I can't find it!  I can't find
               it!  I can't find the fucking gun!


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     For Rath, everything has changed.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square,
     twisting, glancing back, watching.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra nears the room below the fifth story window.

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               It wasn't with his other stuff!


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     Rath is now afraid.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra, get out.


<b>     EXT. SIDE STREET
</b>
     Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black
     plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space
     between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.

<b>                             RATH (V.O.)
</b>               He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

<b>                             ELECTRA
</b>               Oh, God.  I see it!

     She reaches for it, but it's too high.

<b>                             RATH (V.O.)
</b>               Electra, listen!  You have got to
               come to the bank for the money!  The
               money!

     She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back
     toward the stairs.

     Just as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO
     THE LOBBY below.

     She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly.

     Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     The bank is almost empty.  Rath has begun to sweat.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra!

     The Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of
     the green paper blocks.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her.

<b>                             RATH (V.O.)
</b>               Electra!

     The voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off,
     stuffing it in her pocket.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra, what's happening?  What are
               you --

     The Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut.

<b>                             OFFICIAL
</b>               Finido, senor.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the
     fifth floor.  There is no time.
<b>     
</b>     She slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner
     into the room.  He rushes to the window, slamming himself
     against it.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You're gonna take me?  Come on!
               Come on, motherfucker!

     He bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls
     out the assault rifle.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Take this!  Take this, you fuck!

     Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
     lathe.

     He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
     the wall.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Motherfucker!

     He stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the
     bank.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-
               gameover-comeon.


<b>     INT. BANK
</b>
     The sun clock reads six o'clock.

     There is no one left in the bank except for employees and
     guards.

     The Official is at Rath's elbow leading him towards the
     metal gates.

<b>                             OFFICIAL
</b>               We are closed, senor.  Thank you for
               banking with us.

     It is happening as it happened ten years ago.  Rath knows
     that he is unable to stop it.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his
     chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the
     trigger.

     Electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag,
     lifting out her gun.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of
               mark meat!  Come on, come on.  It's
               over!  I know it!  You know it!  We
               know it!

     In the...


<b>     TELESCOPIC SIGHT
</b>
     we watch Rath step out of the bank, the doors closing
     behind him.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Bain smiles.


<b>     INSIDE CLOSET
</b>
     Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep
     orange and auburn cast.

     Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps.

     He steps down to the first stair.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Lift your head, motherfucker.

     Electra is standing.  The gun clenched in her shaking
     hand.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Look up here.


<b>     TELESCOPIC SIGHT
</b>
     The cross-hairs are an "X" on Rath's head.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Look up.  Look at me.  I want to see
               your face.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at
     the window; there is only black shadow.

     He knows it is over.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Yes.

     Electra shoves open the door, leveling the gun --

     As Bain turns.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Wha --

     She FIRES.

     His shoulder explodes, blood spraying the black wall.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     Rath hears BAIN SCREAM.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra.

     His eyes, his whole body comes to life.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as --

     She FIRES again, moving at him.  A chunk of WOOD EXPLODES
     as she misses.

     He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS
     SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS.

     She watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR
     below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him.

     The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but
     he is gone.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA
</b>
     Rath races wildly across the darkening market square.


<b>     INT. BURNED HOTEL
</b>
     Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Die, bitch!

     He FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the
     floor around her feet.

     Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.

     His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and
     rises, listening as --

     She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.

     Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the
     staircase, waiting, until --

     Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that
     they are exposed.

     She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is
     PERFORATED with BULLETS.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you
               doing?  I don't believe this is
               happening!

     She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the
     hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall,
     above; there is nowhere to go.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               You're dead!  You're fucking dead!
               I'm going to kill you a hundred
               fucking times for this!

     Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through
     the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves
     he'll know her position.

     He FIRES another.

     Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at
     the floor.

     Another SHOT.

     She FIRES back.

     Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS,
     flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets.

     Her gun empties first.

     He laughs hearing the CLICK.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Game over, bitch!

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Bain!

     Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building.

     Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a
     ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light
     from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and
     broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-
     like grid resembling a chess board.

     Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing
     the gun over the balcony.

     The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she
     races back to the room.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Fuck no!

     Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to
     the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
     is empty.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Shit!

     Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to
     the end of the hall.

     Rath sees it all happening.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra!

     Bain snaps into a targeting stance.

     Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly
     touching the floor --


<b>     TELESCOPIC SIGHT
</b>
     When the cross-hairs find her back.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra!

     Time becomes syrup.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Down!  Get down!

     Bain FIRES.

     Electra dives.

     The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her.

     She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room.

     Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the
     stairs.

     Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and
     FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back
     down into the shadows.

     Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22.

     Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door.

     Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out
     the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the
     ground and bursts open.

     A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest
     in the middle of the courtyard.

     Rath and Bain both see it.

     Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it.

     Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then
     back at the door.  Something's got to give.

     Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between
     her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door.

     Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502.

     Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a
     slow breath and tears from the shadows --

     Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip,
     the ground a blur beneath him --

     Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath.

     Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip
     as --

     The RIFLE SPITS --

     Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.


<b>     TELESCOPIC SIGHT
</b>
     The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Rath rams the clip in place.

<b>                             BAIN
</b>               Game --

     Bain squeezes the trigger --

     CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief.

     Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the
     balcony but Bain is gone.

     Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun
     trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
     that Bain fell through.

     Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Electra!

     Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster
     flying.

     Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN,
     swallowing her.

     Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH.

     Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the
     open ceiling.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid
               of it!  Throw it!

     She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She
     looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands.

     His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall.

     Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to
     the fourth level through another burned opening.

     Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at
     every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain,
     a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her.

     Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the
     door to room 502.

     Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he
     snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls.

     Rath hears her scream.

     Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her
     to the ground.

     She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face,
     jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious.

     Bain grabs the gun.

     Rath whips into the room BLASTING --

     BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened
     hole.

     Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead.
     Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared
     with blood.

     From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy.

     Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               Are you still thinking that you're
               going to take me?

     Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice,
     searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from
     everywhere.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               No, I don't think you are.  You know
               what I think?

     The voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from
     his eyes.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               I think you're thinking what I'm
               thinking.

     Still dizzy, Electra taps her fist against Rath's chest.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               You know what I'm thinking,
               Bobby-boy?!

     It seems as though Bain is in the room.

<b>                             BAIN (O.S.)
</b>               You know what I'm thinking?!

     Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of
     bullets from the other gun.

     Bain whirls INTO VIEW, his gun whipping around to Rath who
     turns too slow.

     Bain pumps the trigger.  ONE CLICK.  ANOTHER.  And
     ANOTHER.  The gun is empty.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

     He levels his gun.

<b>                             RATH
</b>               Game over.

     Rath FIRES, OVER and OVER, emptying the GUN into Bain's
     head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony
     railing and falls, twisting through lightless space,
     slamming to the stone floor dead.


<b>     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - NIGHT
</b>
     The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting
     from the plaza.

     A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
     beside the boarded hotel.  Although they walk a bit slow,
     leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just
     another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other
     and to a very large suitcase.

<b>                                                 FADE OUT.

<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE
</b>
We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite 
depths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these 
specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and 
racing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick 
glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large 
brownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere.  
It seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial.

<b>EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY
</b>
The planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch 
the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last 
burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A 
BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back 
into an eerie silence.

<b>EXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY
</b>
We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind 
whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About 
seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a 
cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a 
mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE 
humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet 
tall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on 
permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of 
aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; 
'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>
From their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.  
The entrance registers as a black gaping void.

<b>INT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL
</b>
The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's 
banshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling 
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus.  
He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a 
deep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his 
wide forehead, marking him 
different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles 
has been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of 
the hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the 
tunnel.

Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured 
biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He 
hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who 
has found something.

The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered 
on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented 
tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform.  
BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling 
spears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma 
cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' 
helmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances.  
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>
He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra-
violet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing.

He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the 
skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical 
growth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight 
through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A 
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS 
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The 
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they 
themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is 
swift and terrifying, a blur of motion.

Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive 
with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned 
against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away 
his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, 
extended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping 
the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc 
that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two 
are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across 
the PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to 
it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into 
the PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS 
PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. 

It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no 
question as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea 
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his 
companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK 
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first 
PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other.  
What he finds causes him to react with
pity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles 
clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the 
ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to 
him.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife 
quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick 
seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen 
hunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished,

BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark 
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR 
shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more 
than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap 
aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men 
returning from combat.

One more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a 
sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is 
displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED 
BEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes 
smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting.

<b>EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY
</b>
A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the 
PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly 
away, disappearing into the clouds.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the 
PREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. 


<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY
</b>
An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the 
Mothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut 
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly 
look up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious 
mixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script 
runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed 
into it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN 
TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. 

<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
</b>
The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship.  
BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a 
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which 
constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over 
the protective railing. 

WHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the 
ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is 
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, 
it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling.  
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly 
defying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - 
similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a 
view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are 
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a 
hatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening 
mechanical efficiency.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the 
planet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are 
seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt.

<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
</b>
The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to 
red, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter 
from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a 
representation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps 
the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor.  
The causes the QUEEN to go
berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's 
obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen.  
The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an 
energy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops 
in, and is no more.

<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS
</b>
An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows 
into long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat 
slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable 
arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across 
the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it 
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before 
finally getting to his feet. 

<b>INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
</b>
The lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters.  He 
watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto 
one of the EGGS, then runs his hand in sequence over the control board.  
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a 
waiting pallet. 

BROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural 
CLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat.  The effect is not unlike that 
of a child firing an imaginary gun.  As if reading BROKEN TOOTH's 
thoughts, the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous 
HISS of contempt.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
In CENTER FRAME, the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous 
clouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view, 
sunlight glinting from it's surface.  It's a rectangular satellite-
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a 
latticework of steel tubing.  We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.  
Subspace chatter.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
</b>
Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of 
treetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet 
Ryushi.

Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin 
Communications Relay Station.  Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension 
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of 
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on 
platforms, much like a truncated oil-rig.  A navigation beacon flashes 
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the 
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes 
high.  Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled 
haulage vehicle.  A flock of bird-like creatures fly past.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
We're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with 
clusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-
traffic control tower.  On the upper tier, a large circular holo-
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw.  Thin 
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air 
conditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of 
the people manning the consoled here.  We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER 
and ROB PARSONS, two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank.  
CASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset. 

<b>CASSIE
</b>Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'.  I've 
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix.  Hold on 
my mark until I get back with some confirmation.  Rimward Traffic 
Control out.

She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.

<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)
</b>How's it looking?

PARSONS worriedly shakes his head.

<b>PARSONS
</b>That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Better tell the boss.

PARSONS pulls out a coin.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Toss you for it.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
</b>
HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling 
across her Oriental features.  Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to 
assess from where the next attack will come.  She doesn't have to wait 
long; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking 
without hesitation.

She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly.  A persistent TONE 
begins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING.  She tries to ignore 
it, but her concentration is clearly broken.  A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears 
from out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest.  The blade 
plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back.  She glances 
down in annoyed disbelief.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Fuck!  Holo off.

The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear.  She sheathes the 
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to 
her desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud.  The 
RINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel 
replaced with a black girl's face.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Noguchi.

CASSIE  (O.S., onscreen)
Something just came up on Deep Space Tracking.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What kind of 'something'?

CASSIE   (O.S., onscreen)
Easier if you come down and look.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I'm on my way.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
</b>
An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, 
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty 
main-street.  A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds 
indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's 
approach.  The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt, 
while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS.  

DON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted 
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He 
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the 
street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in 
the gentle breeze.  A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open 
before him. 

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
KAMEN steps into the command center, nodding familiarly to the DUTY 
PERSONNEL.  A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN, wagging it's 
tail. Her name is BREWSTER.  She's the base mascot.  KAMEN reaches down 
and ruffles it's fur.  He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier, 
pulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE, an Italian systems-
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console.

<b>URIOSTE
</b>You didn't wipe your feet coming in.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Well, it's okay.  You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out.

PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Hey, buenos dias, cowboy.  When d'you blow in?

KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Just got back.  Missed anything?

URIOSTE   (snorts)
Yeah.  We're almost out of beer.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste. She's still pissed that 
Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip.

KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Wasn't my trip, I just did the driving. 'Sides, freezing my butt off 
out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of 
a good time, either.

He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Where'd you leave them?

<b>KAMEN
</b>Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making 
their own way back tomorrow.

<b>CASSIE
</b>MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Shit.  When?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story 
on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

KAMEN looks ill.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.

<b>CASSIE
</b>You win some, you loose some.

<b>KAMEN
</b>I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything 
else you wanna ruin my day with?

<b>CASSIE
</b>No, but I got something that might interest you.

HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What've you got?

KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They 
turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of 
the neighboring solar system.

<b>CASSIE
</b>A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen 
twenty-four local time.

<b>PARSONS
</b>We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just 
to make sure.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.

The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading 
towards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations 
accompany them.

<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)
</b>Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a 
deep-space drive.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.

<b>PARSONS
</b>That's what we thought.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Done it already.  Nothing matches.

<b>CASSIE
</b>And if you thought that was interesting, watch this...

HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Jesus.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're 
looking at.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Tactical nukes, maybe?

Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's 
obviously not an appealing thought.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Where're they headed?

<b>CASSIE
</b>We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's 
possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant 
glances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed 
back to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp 
Base, too.

PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON
</b>
Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in 
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana 
bayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for 
cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, 
a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped 
hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME 
suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a 
swirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES 
scatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol 
boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in 
the other.

YORK   (yelling)
You missed 'em, Ackland!

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the 
other side.

YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two 
bikes ROAR off in pursuit.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON
</b>
Up on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two 
blinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp.  It looks a little like 
a Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details.  
A hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a 
mug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber 
bullets into a belt-feed.  They 
watch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING.  MINH scrambles out of 
the way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him. 

<b>MINH
</b>Crazy idiots.

BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you.  
Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em.  Just a 
couple of weekend warriors...

She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the 
belt feed.  On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism.

<b>BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)
</b>Nice howitzer you've got there.

<b>MINH
</b>Thanks.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?

<b>MINH
</b>Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the 
rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock 
you a month's pay for just mentioning it.

He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.

<b>MINH (CONT'D)
</b>Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it, 
though.

<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE
</b>
Against a sea of stars, a small metal shape HURTLES towards us, 
followed moments later by it's identical twin.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON
</b>
A strand of HIROKO's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain.  
She brushes up at the miserable weather.  She and KAMEN are standing on 
one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage 
vehicle we saw outside the base earlier.  Up on the side of the cab is 
painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is 
the legend 'BIG BERTHA'.  Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN 
DILLER, watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage 
point of KAMEN's crawler parked in the swamp nearby.

<b>KAMEN
</b>See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the 
pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on 
these new plastics.

<b>HIROKO
</b>We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module.  
That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares 
in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.

KAMEN shrugs.

<b>KAMEN
</b>If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only 
choice you've got.

DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.

<b>DILLER
</b>Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>You offering?

A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF.  DILLER gets up to answer.

<b>DILLER
</b>Nah.  Freeze my dick off.

HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I don't know.  I think we'll have to run it on a rota; one month down, 
one month operational.

DILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.

<b>DILLER
</b>Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Thanks.

She turns back to KAMEN.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
HIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern.  A sense of 
urgency buzzes around the room.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>When?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings 
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too 
close for comfort.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Can we move it to a different orbit in time?

PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Already working on it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.

She meets KAMEN's eyes.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Looks like you were right.  Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles 
at us.

KAMEN shakes his head.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother?  
All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control 
net.  That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists.

PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Okay, give me the numbers.

She flips a switch.  A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path 
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
A cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites, 
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move.

<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE
</b>
The two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked 
alteration in their course.

<b>PARSONS
</b>They've changed their heading again.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Compensate!

<b>PARSONS
</b>Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.

<b>CASSIE
</b>What do you need?

<b>PARSONS
</b>A three-second burn to port, on my mark.

<b>CASSIE
</b>It's on the board.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the PREDATOR pods rocket 
towards the communications platform.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Picking up velocity.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Match it!

A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Not gonna make it...

<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE
</b>
The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters 
of the monitors abruptly turn to static.  PARSONS curses.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Goddammit!

He pulls off his headset with weary resignation.

<b>PARSONS (CONT'D)
</b>We've lost the downlink.  It's gone.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end.  A gaping rent is torn  
through it; something sparks and flashes within.  The second pod 
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK
</b>
A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an 
object sear across the dusk sky.  He pulls his bike to a stationary 
hover.

<b>YORK
</b>Shit!  What's that?

ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the 
ground.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few 
plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before 
settling back into an eerie silence.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Meteor, I guess.

He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.  THROUGH THEM 
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>D'you feel any impact shock?

YORK   (uncertain)
Not really.

He lowers the binoculars and frowns.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, 
and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.

<b>YORK
</b>Do you wanna head back and call it in?

ACKLAND   (hesitant)
I dunno... I dunno.  Something about this feels funny.

He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky.

<b>ACKLAND (CONT'D)
</b>That is the damndest impact I've ever saw...

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK
</b>
The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the 
surrounding brush still aflame.  A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to 
the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.  We 
HEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.  Before the SCORPION 
can decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.  A large METAL CLAW comes 
down, crushing it in an instant.  A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE 
heaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.  It 
pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves 
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.  A hatch on the 
underside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.  After a 
moment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.  In it's place 
is an ALIEN EGG.  The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long 
reeds.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up 
to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night 
impenetrable.  Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the 
communications array strobe on-and-off.  Above the bar on the main 
street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with 
the words "TORCHY'S".  The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within 
become momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's 
pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN 
follows them through.  He spots HIROKO and heads over.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?

She shakes her head, and manages a smile.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too 
crowded for me.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Not too much of the socializing type, then?

<b>HIROKO
</b>No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.

KAMEN LAUGHS.  HIROKO is straight-faced.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary 
installations.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Is that a fact.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and 
want to claw open a vacuum hatch.

<b>KAMEN
</b>How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Four.

<b>KAMEN
</b>And before that?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Six month stint on Datus.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Only six?

<b>HIROKO
</b>What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?

<b>KAMEN
</b>Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.

HIROKO shrugs.  Thinks about it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I don't know.  I guess I've just never found anywhere I really felt at 
home.

She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease.  
KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads.

<b>KAMEN
</b>What is that?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Real man' drink.

She offers the glass to him.  He takes it and sniff cautiously.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Seltzer?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Want some?

KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.

<b>KAMEN
</b>I'll stick with my own.

He sits with her and stares into the darkness.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Any luck raising Ackland's party?

<b>KAMEN
</b>Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain 
range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

<b>HIROKO
</b>First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

<b>KAMEN
</b>'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.

HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>This whole thing's got me spooked.

KAMEN hops off the wheel.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone 
figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look-
see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find 
whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?

<b>KAMEN
</b>There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

<b>EXT.  SPACE
</b>
A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the 
incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent 
torn through it, and pauses.

FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made 
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a 
cold, black mass.

The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly 
on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. 

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT
</b>
Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness.  
YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Found anything?

YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi-
purpose readout screen.

<b>YORK
</b>Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.

<b>YORK
</b>What is it?

ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the 
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>It's a rhino.

<b>YORK
</b>Is it dead?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your 
stick's not broken.

YORK looks at the data-stick again.

<b>YORK
</b>Yeah, it's fine.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

<b>YORK
</b>I told you we... what's that?

Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?

<b>YORK
</b>Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.

<b>YORK (CONT'D)
</b>Careful...

There's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree 
with him.

A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a 
BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.

<b>YORK
</b>Let's get back and call this in.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Wait a minute.

YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing 
foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to 
partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over 
something at the bottom of the shallow pit.

<b>YORK
</b>What is that... is that metal fragments?

ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>This is very fucking weird.

He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the 
broken foliage.

<b>ACKLAND (CONT'D)
</b>It's like something came out of the crater and went that way...

There's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the 
safety off his rifle.  ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.  They 
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to...

<b>YORK
</b>Another one?

ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Yeah.  This's closed.

There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in 
four sections.  The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS 
nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.  ACKLAND cranes his 
neck forward for a better look...

There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.  A spindly shape with a long 
segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.  It's a 
FACEHUGGER.  ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.  His finger 
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.  A volley 
of shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE 
BOOM, and we...

<b>CUT TO
</b>...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.  SOMETHING is watching them 
from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.  A PREDATOR.  We 
see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi-
colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, 
before we... 

<b>CUT BACK TO
</b>...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as 
he races forward to help his friend.  The HUGGER's tail is already 
around ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.  YORK 
pulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an 
instant.  What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's 
face, and the questing tendril on
the HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips.  
In a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's 
grasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING 
SOUND.  YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few 
feet away.  He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving 
altogether.

<b>YORK
</b>Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.

The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as 
YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we...

<b>CUT TO
</b>A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging 
ACKLAND's body away from the crater.  It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, 
giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around 
the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.

YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue 
trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling 
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.  There's movement on 
the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to 
another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.  The HUGGER's 
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the 
movement akin to somebody drumming their
fingers on a table-top.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT
</b>
As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND 
from the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.  YORK 
clutches his rifle and stares upward.  There seems to be a VAGUE 
SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.  Although it might be a trick 
of the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.  YORK guns the bike 
to life and ROARS off above the swamp.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>We're looking at the site in colours:  the cold blue of empty ALIEN 
EGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the 
FACEHUGGER parasites.

A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their 
camouflage cloaks deactivated.  The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to 
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE 
curled up there.  Most of it has been madly mutilated by something 
erupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the 
swamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a 
band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing 
different levels of SOUND STATIC.  This abruptly stops as the 
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.  The PREDATOR is 
picking up radio
waves.  A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
</b>
We hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn 
against intruding animals.  The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent, 
bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.  She's suddenly wide awake 
when she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red 
strobe.  It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of 
silt.  YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten 
the straps holding ACKLAND's body.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>Jesus Christ!  What happened?

<b>YORK
</b>Give me a hand with Ack.

She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>How bad is... oh my God.

As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a 
FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed. 

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>What is that?

<b>YORK
</b>Don't... uuh... don't know.  Help me... uuh... help me get him inside.  
Shit!

YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.  He slumps 
slowly to the floor.

BEAUVAIS   (yelling)
Minh!  Minh, get out here!

<b>INT.  TENT - NIGHT
</b>
A portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish 
light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.  MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it 
in horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his 
thigh.  He winces. 

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>Have you tried prising it off?

YORK shakes his head.

<b>YORK
</b>I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base.

<b>MINH
</b>Forget it.  We lost the satellite link. It's dead.

There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.

<b>MINH
</b>Oh man...

<b>YORK
</b>Get real, Beauvais!  That thing might chew his fucking face off for all 
be know!

The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' 
head-jerk.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>Minh...

<b>MINH
</b>Yep...

MINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on 
YORK, continuing.

<b>BEAUVAIS
</b>How do you know it's not already?

<b>YORK
</b>I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look...

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
</b>
MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of 
the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He 
studies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He 
shakes his head in 
disgust.

MINH   (muttering)
Take a goddamn wrench to those things...

He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, 
and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the 
weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a 
target.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing 
trigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it...

The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking 
something automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off 
three shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from 
MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a 
mass of luminous green liquid and motion.

MINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck)
God.

MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a 
SPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in 
an instant.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION. 
</b>Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the 
PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH.

A BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, 
spraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of 
pained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing 
across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to 
take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger 
guard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an 
unseen shape races at her.  There's a loud

SWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air.  
It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and 
impaling her against a tree.

YORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later 
her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken 
marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS 
disappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch 
trickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it 
zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon 
following suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the 
plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg.

His options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for 
that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips 
it.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded 
PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns 
the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS 
an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE 
ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade 
slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta-
wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into 
the swamp.

YORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the 
rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR 
handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their 
camouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK 
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more 
cannon-blasts blossom around him.

The group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the 
area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses 
to the tent and opens the entry flap.

<b>INT.  TENT - NIGHT
</b>
<b>PREDATOR-VISION. 
</b>The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on 
ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
</b>
We PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.  There isn't a soul there, 
human or otherwise.  The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs. 

<b>EXT.  RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN
</b>
First light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.  A 'chopper' - 
actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist 
hanging over the treetops.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN
</b>
The cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back.  
KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.  The controls 
moving by themselves, on autopilot.  A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN 
to look up from his magazine.

<b>KAMEN'S P.O.V.
</b>From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of 
the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees.

KAMEN nudges HIROKO awake.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Wake up.  We're at the beacon.

He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down.  
HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
</b>
Twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep 
across the clearing.  The encampment has been wrecked, much of is 
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.  All-terrain gear lowers 
from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN
</b>
KAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.  KAMEN hauls an 
automatic pulse-rifle from the rear. 

<b>KAMEN
</b>Looks like trouble.

KAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol.  
Passes it to her.

<b>KAMEN (CONT'D)
</b>Used one of these before?

HIROKO coolly examines it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O' 
rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can 
handle this.

HIROKO's show-boating and KAMEN knows it, but he still can't help being 
a little bit impressed.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Okay.  Watch were you point it...

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
</b>
The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred 
canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has 
burned through.

HIROKO   (quietly)
Somebody picked an argument.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Yeah.  Somebody won.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Check out the tent.

KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the 
wreckage dotted around the perimeter.

<b>INT.  TENT - DAWN
</b>
KAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside.  ACKLAND's on the cot, 
sweating heavily.  There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
</b>
Across the clearing, HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in 
her hands before discarding it.

Her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud.  It's MINH's 
'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.  She crouches down 
and rubs her fingers through it.  Blood.  KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S.

<b>KAMEN   (O.S.)
</b>I've found Ackland!

<b>HIROKO
</b>Hold on...

She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of 
rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the 
face and knocking her off her feet.  HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and 
surprise, then freezes at what she sees.

Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS 
and MINH.  Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.  KAMEN 
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.  He stops 
in his tracks.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Jesus palomino...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING
</b>
It's raining again at the base.  Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO 
watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic 
trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late 
thirties.  As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO 
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.  KAMEN runs after 
REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Wait a minute, Doc...

He hands the bag over to REVNA.  She peers at the contents curiously.  
The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled. 

<b>REVNA
</b>Is this it?

<b>KAMEN
</b>Yeah.  Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.  Any idea?

REVNA shakes her head.

<b>REVNA
</b>Never come across one of these before. Maybe the original survey team 
did.  I'll run it through records and see what comes up.

GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley.  KAMEN 
raps him on the back to get his attention.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>What's the problem?

<b>KAMEN
</b>She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines 
might be playing up.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Appreciate that.

REVNA interrupts.

<b>REVNA
</b>Where're the bodies?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Bagged and in the back.  They're not a pretty sight.

ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator.  As KAMEN and HIROKO walk 
away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself 
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad. 

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.
</b>A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay-
station with great interest.  An oscillating red line appears to the 
LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKO's voice-pattern.

PREDATOR   (O.S., distorted)
Not a pretty sight.  Not a pretty sight...

He reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DAY
</b>
Under the cathedral-like light filtering through the trees above, a row 
of metal spikes have been driven into the earth.  Four are topped with 
still-smoking ALIEN skulls.  Two and empty.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>A newly decapitated ALIEN head is turned around in another PREDATOR's 
hands in admiration.  This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next 
spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment.  His wrist 
computer BLEEPS for attention...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
With nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining 
personnel bored.  PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the 
console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby. 

<b>HIROKO
</b>I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with 
something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Agreed.

<b>HIROKO
</b>When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right 
now.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What do you mean?

URIOSTE walks up, very serious.  She interrupts.

<b>URIOSTE
</b>Sorry.  Can I have a word?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Sure.  What's up?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.  The algae must have clogged up an 
intake duct.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Think I spoke too soon...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable.  
Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah...

HIROKO knows what she means.  BEAUVAIS is dead.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Can you handle it?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>Sure, I can manage.  But I'm not going into the Pit on my own.

HIROKO   (to Urioste)
Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.   (to Kamen)   Is that 
alright?

<b>KAMEN
</b>Yeah, no problem.  Ask Diller, he's good with his hands.

URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE.

<b>CASSIE
</b>I'll go along with that.

A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up 
to answer.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Parsons.   (long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY
</b>
A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a 
hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained 
consciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a 
cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical 
equipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a 
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting 
blades and surgical paraphernalia.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really.

REVNA flicks off the probe.

<b>REVNA
</b>Headache?  Dehydration?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

<b>REVNA
</b>Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours.  
I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.

REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.

<b>REVNA (CONT'D)
</b>He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright 
I'm prepared to believe him.  He's all yours.

HIROKO enters.  She watches from behind KAMEN.

<b>KAMEN
</b>What happened out there, Ack?

ACKLAND   (consternated)
What do you mean, 'what happened'?  What am I doing back here?  Where's 
York?

HIROKO   (insistent)
What's the last thing you can remember?

ACKLAND thinks hard.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's.

HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.

<b>HIROKO
</b>A meteor?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Yeah, it impacted really off.  We went out to the crash-site... and... 
uh... that's... that's all.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Nothing else?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>No.

KAMEN turns to REVNA.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Show him 'Fido'.

REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack.  She 
hands it to ACKLAND.  He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside 
with morbid fascination.

<b>REVNA
</b>Ring any bells?

ACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard 
on his mind.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Not really, no.  Ugly little sonuvabitch. What is it?

<b>KAMEN
</b>We thought you might be able to tell us. I found it by your cot at the 
camp.  You were out cold.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>What did York say?

<b>HIROKO
</b>York's vanished.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Vanished?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland.  York's gone awol, unless you can 
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime 
suspect right now.

The news hits ACKLAND hard.  He falters and leans back, addressing 
<b>REVNA.
</b>
<b>ACKLAND
</b>Can I... um... have some water?  Please?

<b>REVNA
</b>Sure.

She goes to fetch a cup.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMISSARY
</b>
It's lunchtime, and the SOUND of machinery STEAMING food mixes with the 
CHATTER of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there.  HIROKO and KAMEN 
are deep in conversation across a table.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Do you believe him?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on 
Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure.  
There's not much we can do out here.

KAMEN stares hard at her.  That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO 
knows it. She capitulates.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Alright then, For what it's worth... yes, I do.

KAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork.

<b>KAMEN
</b>You should try this seasoned stuff.  It's good.

GUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Got a present for you.

He hands HIROKO's leather jacket over to her.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Oh, I've been looking for this!  Where was it?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>You left it in the chopper.  Oh, and before I forget, Don?  I ran that 
test you wanted on the turbines.

<b>KAMEN
</b>And...?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON
</b>
A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.  DILLER leans 
against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly 
blowing rings into the air.  BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to 
quietly SNARL.  DILLER glances down at her curiously.

<b>DILLER
</b>What's the matter, girl?  You smell something?

Now the rhino are restless too.  CASSIE walks across the concrete 
roadway to join them.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Rhinos look a little antsy,

BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.

<b>DILLER
</b>Yeah.  Never seem 'em act like this before.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter' 
still.  Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of 
unrecognizability, eerily distorted.

CASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Do you hear that?

DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a 
FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.

<b>DILLER
</b>Yeah...

A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as 
it hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, 
it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through 
the air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the 
ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.

<b>CASSIE
</b>I don't believe it.

DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the 
mire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg.

<b>DILLER
</b>He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Wait a minute...

Something else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A "something" almost two 
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike.  
Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the 
PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.

<b>CASSIE (CONT'D)
</b>Holy Mary...

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.
</b>The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the 
weapon over in her hands.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY
</b>
REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she 
GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal.  
The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of 
the computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle 
THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably 
on his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Oh.  Oh God...

REVNA lowers her pen and looks across.

<b>REVNA
</b>What is it?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

<b>REVNA
</b>Do you want a tablet?

ACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods.

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Uh-huh.

REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's 
beginning to COUGH now.

<b>REVNA
</b>That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine.

ACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging 
his chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red 
tablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully 
and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens 
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.

<b>REVNA (CONT'D)
</b>Better?

<b>ACKLAND
</b>Yeah...

Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin 
spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her 
cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to 
hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the 
process.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.

<b>REVNA
</b>Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot...

Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical 
instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a 
vial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto 
the floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the 
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND 
convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the 
ceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again.

We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in 
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across 
the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body 
moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it.

WHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, 
revealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are 
just visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform 
- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of 
still-underdeveloped arms.

Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from 
ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance.  
After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a 
table.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red 
stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed.

The room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the 
creature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She 
cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of 
probe-arms. 

There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery.  
REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's 
armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER...

There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the 
hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL 
SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We 
hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR
</b>
HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, 
CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays 
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making 
access difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open 
revealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the 
bulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What happened?

<b>DILLER
</b>York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

HIROKO   (astonished)
York...

HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from 
within the Infirmary distracts her.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>What's going on?

<b>CASSIE
</b>The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds 
like Ackland's going nuts.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Force the door.

<b>DILLER
</b>Can't.  It's pressure sealed.

GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Here...

<b>DILLER
</b>Thanks.

He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical 
effort showing on his face.  The door grinds open about eight inches... 

The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING 
vehemently.  Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull, 
dissolving everything it comes into contact with.  The small group 
gathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking 
HIROKO to the floor.  BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses 
as if to leap.
DILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and 
takes flight.  It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head 
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek.  
The ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared 
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring.  
GUTTIEREZ bends down and
helps HIROKO to her feet.  Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in 
JAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Get after it, don't let it get away!

DILLER stands there with the metal bar.  Does she think he's nuts?

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Go on!

This galvanises DILLER.  He races off in pursuit.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Jan, give me a hand over here.

HIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door, but DILLER was right - it 
won't budge.  HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around 
blindly.  She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides 
back.  CASSIE looks inside.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Oh my God...

She turns away and retches.  HIROKO steps through and goes pale.  There 
are blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop 
BREWSTER from getting in there.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
PARSONS' finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics 
displayed on a suspended glass screen.

<b>PARSONS
</b>It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...

<b>HIROKO
</b>What is that?

<b>DILLER
</b>Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating 
ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Where does that lead to?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed 
out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-
out.

<b>HIROKO
</b>You've checked that end?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Not yet, no.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Do it.  I don't want that thing on my installation.  I want it caught 
and destroyed.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is 
basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off 
external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, 
we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That 
should give us ample time to find it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign 
a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it 
on the board.

CASSIE nods soberly.  HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are 
carefully chosen.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>I don't care how you kill this thing, just be careful not to get in 
it's way when it bleeds.  You all saw what happened to Doc Revna.

There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs.  
Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down 
with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.

<b>DILLER
</b>Okay.

<b>HIROKO
</b>One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in 
itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a 
hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.

This seems to appeal to those assembled there.  There's a palpable buzz 
in the air.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Alright, let's get to it.  New York rules apply.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
</b>
YORK is recounting his story to KAMEN and HIROKO in a hushed voice.  
Small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted 
by remembrance.  The man's a mess.

<b>YORK
</b>...I mean, these... these mothers were... were huge.  They look like 
bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em.  
They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.  Minh got 
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well 
have been using a B-B gun.  I don't know how the hell I made it out of 
there alive.

He nods toward the PREDATOR spear in HIROKO's hands.

<b>YORK (CONT'D)
</b>The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me.  Whatever it's 
made of, it went straight through a double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy 
composite like it was butter.

YORK shakes his head in fear.

<b>YORK (CONT'D)
</b>I don't wanna ever come up against those things again.  Ever.

KAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Don't worry about it, Yorkie.  You're safe now.  Go get come rest.

YORK nods.  He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits 
until the door slides shut behind him.

<b>HIROKO
</b>So, what do you think?

<b>KAMEN
</b>What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift 
their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the 
middle of something we shouldn't.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
It's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light 
across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES - 
a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily 
about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are 
searching around in the BACKGROUND.  Nearby, the vertical yellow column 
of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>C'mon, man.  One more sweep.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more 
fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, 
and found zip.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.

DE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Listen to that...

GUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.  He has no idea what she means.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Listen to what?

<b>DE VRIES
</b>That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's 
unnatural.

GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable 
blackness beyond the confines of the base.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>De Vries?

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Yeah?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

BREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the 
meshwork fence of their pens.  The animals move around in agitation.  
Not at her, but at something else...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Something spooking the rhinos?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>I dunno.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK
</b>
<b>PREDATOR-VISION. 
</b>The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the 
platform's edge, bright red.

Indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS 
wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
DARKNESS.  DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.  The 
scraping of METAL-ON-METAL.

<b>DILLER
</b>What is that...is that it?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>No.  I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on.

There's more NOISE.

<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)
</b>Ah, got it...!

About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber 
illuminate.  Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining 
unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse-
rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.  She's carrying a portable 
- but bulky - piece of machinery.

<b>URIOSTE
</b>Are you getting anything?

DILLER   (sarcastic)
Yeah, eyestrain.  What's with the lights?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>They're always like that.  Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to 
spares.  Wave that thing in the corner...

DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.  The small screen registers 
nothing.

<b>DILLER
</b>The room's clean.

<b>URIOSTE
</b>Great.

URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the 
floor.  It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. 
Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its 
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on 
either side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume 
of steam JETS out of the valve.

<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)
</b>Give me a hand with this.

GRUNTING, the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit.  
Murky water sloshes around below.  URIOSTE pulls a second lever, and 
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly.

<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)
</b>Pass me over that tripod, will you?

Leaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped 
with a block-and-tackle arrangement.  A hook dangles below this, it's 
thick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and 
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to 
the wall.  DILLER hands the tripod over to URIOSTE.  She splays the 
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open 
pit.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES walk over to the rhino pen, BREWSTER pulling at 
her leash.  GUTTIEREZ frowns at what he sees.  All the rhinos are 
nervously huddled together in the far corner.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>That's real peculiar behavior.

DE VRIES fingers a rough metal edge.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Hey, Guttierez?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>What?

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Take a look at this.

GUTTIEREZ moves over for a closer look.  There's a torn hole in the 
meshwork, just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through.  Blood and 
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>One of 'em must have escaped.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking 
tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it 
up.

GUTTIEREZ shines the flashlight along the deck.  A trail of smeared 
blood runs all the way to the perimeter.  The surrounding fence has 
been buckled and twisted.  They cross to it and look down at the swamp.  
The torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>That's a fact.

GUTTIEREZ' tracker starts to BLEEP.  He raises it excitedly.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Whoa, wait a minute...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Just got a reading...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Most of the lights in Admin are off, and the room's deserted.  PARSONS 
is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten 
monitor screens, each displaying a securi-cam picture.  He looks tired.  
KAMEN comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee.

<b>KAMEN
</b>How's it going?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

He takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it.

<b>PARSONS (CONT'D)
</b>Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now.  
Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.

<b>KAMEN
</b>You should hit the sack, too.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.

<b>KAMEN
</b>What time's sundown?

<b>PARSONS
</b>'Bout five minutes.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Give me a yell is something happens.

<b>PARSONS
</b>You got it, cowboy.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
GUTTIEREZ sweeps the tracker slowly around, and BREWSTER begins to 
gently SNARL.  
DE VRIES pulls on the dog's leash to quieten her.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>It's up there somewhere...

He shoulders his rifle.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Come on.

A metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings.  
GUTTIEREZ crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Forget it, man.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if 
it wasn't night.

GUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What the hell are you doing?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

DE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.  Comes to a 
decision counter to what she wants to do...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Wait a minute!

GUTTIEREZ stops climbing.

<b>DE VRIES (CONT'D)
</b>Alright, okay.  Look...

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>What?

<b>DE VRIES
</b>I'll come with you.

BREWSTER BARKS.  She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties 
the leash around it.

<b>DE VRIES (CONT'D)
</b>But I'm going first...

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Anything you say, Mammacitta.

She climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.  BREWSTER 
WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
</b>
The rooftop is dark, mysterious.  Pieces of retrofitted junk can be 
seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.  DE VRIES and 
GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.  They speak in WHISPERS.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Careful of that edging there...

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Yeah, I got it.

Although we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up 
here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable. 

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Where's that flashlight?

By way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.  DE 
VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.  Circular 
extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom.

<b>DE VRIES (CONT'D)
</b>Still got him?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.

DE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Little bit further...

The beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.  A short-
range antennae, about seven feet wide.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think 
we're got it cornered...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
HIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with 
the roadway.  The broken grillework is melted outwards.  KAMEN and two 
other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind.

<b>THOMAS
</b>The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.  It must have 
come straight out of here.

HIROKO yawns.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Alright.  Keep your eyes peeled.

She voices her concern to KAMEN.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
</b>
It's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and 
DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Hold it, hold it...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What's wrong?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>I'm picking up another signal.

DE VRIES looks around, unnerved.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What?  Where?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Just behind us, over to the right.

DE VRIES shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their 
rear, shifting her attention to-and-fro from it and the antennae.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Yeah, I...

The second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Wait.  Lost it.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>How?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>I dunno.  Might be a glitch.

From behind the metal disc there comes a SHUFFLING SOUND, followed by a 
METALLIC THUNK.  This gets their attention.  The two of them halt in 
their tracks.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Oh, man.  That's no glitch!

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>It's alright, it's cool...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Is it still moving?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe.  
Nice and easy...

A small many-limbed SHAPE hurls itself from the confines of it's hiding 
place with a FERAL SHRIEK.  DE VRIES YELPS in surprise, and looses off 
a spray of bullets.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
HIROKO looks up, startled by the sound of GUNFIRE.  She sees the 
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire.  BREWSTER's 
tethered nearby, BARKING furiously.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
</b>
A think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in 
the gloom of the Pump Shaft.  In front of her is a machine-part we saw 
her carry earlier.  With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her 
mouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of 
machinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch 
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge.

The REPORT of DE VRIES' weapon can be heard even down here, perhaps 
more startling in the confined space.  URIOSTE jumps, dropping the 
flashlight into the water in the process.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
DILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access 
tunnel leading outside.  URIOSTE's VOICE floats up out of the shaft. 

URIOSTE   (O.S., muffled)
What was that?

DILLER   (raising his voice)
Something outside...

</b>
The wind whips at GUTTIEREZ as he blinks away his shock.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Holy shit...

DE VRIES keeps her torch beam on the moving shape.  It halts by the 
edge of the roof, and stares at them.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Oh, nice going, man!  It was a lemur! A goddamn lemur!

GUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life.

HIROKO   (O.S., on headset)
Guttierez, what the hell's going on up there?

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Uh... sorry about that, boss.  Everything's fine.  False alarm, that's 
all.

DE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Hey, look; let's forget it.  There's nothing up here.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing brightly.  Her VOICE replayed and 
distorted.

<b>PREDATOR   (O.S.)
</b>Nothing up here.  Nothing up here.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
</b>
URIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and 
well out of reach.

URIOSTE    (disgustedly)
Shit.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
What's the matter?

<b>URIOSTE
</b>I've dropped my torch into the water. Give me about... uh... a meter-
and-a-half's worth of slack.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
Okay.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.  On the mechanism's side is a 
luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He 
pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5" 
as the cable feeds out.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
</b>
URIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls.  
Her feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go.

<b>URIOSTE (CONT'D)
</b>Whoa, whoa...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
URIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled)
That's enough.

DILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE 
of the cable-feed stops immediately.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
</b>
URIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers.  
It's... just... about... in... reach...

Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp 
like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, 
trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM 
forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps 
firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the 
winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an 
angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps 
from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening 
rate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; 
"11...11.5...12...12.5...13..."  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular 
legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for 
the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the 
over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the 
shaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the 
deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by 
the colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy 
piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear 
noisily into the conduit.

<b>DILLER
</b>Annie!

DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.

<b>DILLER (CONT'D)
</b>Annie!

He feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness.

WHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the 
ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft 
walls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door.  
Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, 
grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the 
safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it 
back into the pit.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
</b>
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>The hell was that?

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the 
platform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people 
running towards the source of the shots...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
</b>
DILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER 
ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the 
threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
In a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow 
catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead.  
DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides 
with him. 

<b>KAMEN
</b>Kev, wha...?

DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about 
to say something, but never gets the chance.

There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express 
train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
</b>
<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black 
SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans...

From the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She 
violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that 
barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. 

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
PARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed 
to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. 

<b>PARSONS
</b>Oh my God...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, 
splintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into 
THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's 
questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the 
ground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people 
it's impossible to get a clean 
shot...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Move!  Get out of the way!

HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her 
rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger.  
It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying.  
CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It 
strikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's 
chest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that...

The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is 
inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth 
open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike...

WHOOMPH.  Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk.  The 
ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS.  A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM 
appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic 
fluid.  The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's 
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant.  The STINGER 
makes contact:  there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking 
device begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses 
of it's natural form.  Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's 
ruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his 
arm...

From out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in 
a compactor.  HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to 
the door panel.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Get the door!

KAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior 
pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together.  A SECOND ALIEN appears from the 
shadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap, 
struggling for purchase.  Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door 
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid 
CLUNK.  MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side.

Nearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight 
and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR.  At the last possible 
moment HIROKO sees what he's about to do...

<b>HIROKO
</b>No!

Reflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of 
shots.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION. 
</b>The PREDATOR's speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white-
hot bullets sear the night.

<b>PREDATOR
</b>No!

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.  
</b>SNAPPING IN for a closer look at her.

<b>PREDATOR (CONT'D)
</b>No!

One of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and 
wrenches it off.  HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination.  
From the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK.  The 
PREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to 
follow.  In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up, 
slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head.  In a feat of 
strength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the 
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing...

Not wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of 
some twenty feet with astounding grace.  He grips a pipe running down 
the side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's 
edge and finally disappears from view.  BREWSTER continues to BARK 
frenetically. 

HIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED 
VOICE is coming from it.  She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit' 
switch. 

HIROKO   (into headset)
It's alright, Rob...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
PARSONS listens to HIROKO, suddenly wide awake.  The morning shifts are 
starting to filter in, and it's obvious to them something's wrong...

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speaker)
Everything's under control.  Wait a second.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
THOMAS is moving from DILLER to CALDWELL, checking them for signs of 
life. HIROKO catches his eye.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Well?

THOMAS shakes his head.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES race across the 
platform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish.  GUTTIEREZ 
bends down by DILLER's body.  THOMAS lays a hand on GUTTIEREZ' arm.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Come on, man.  Leave it alone.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Oh, God.  Dear Lord Jesus...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>This is like a bad dream, man.  A bad fucking dream.

HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision.  She speaks into her 
radio headset.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Rob?  I want you to evac everybody from the non-connective modules into 
admin. That goes double for anybody...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
HIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speaker)
...already out here.  We're going to lock every bulkhead and seal the 
base.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
HIROKO turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured 
lights dotted around the platform start to blink on-and-off.  KAMEN 
COUGHS a few more times.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Are you okay?

KAMEN rubs his throat.  He nods.

<b>KAMEN
</b>I'll survive.

BREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What's with the dog?

GUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER.  Lowers his rifle to the ground and 
fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Hey; c'mon now, girl.  It's alright.  Let's just get this knot 
undone...

A spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ.  
The rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as 
an ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and 
glistening...

<b>KAMEN
</b>Jan!

BREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control.  When the ALIEN 
lashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can 
do.  BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as 
she's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Get out of there, man!

THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards 
GUTTIEREZ, with 
DE VRIES close behind... 

<b>THOMAS
</b>Catch this!

From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid 
limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle 
over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it 
awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Chew on this!

DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances 
down at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots 
of them.

KAMEN   (hollering)
They're all around, they're in the drainage system!

DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging 
ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Get your ass out of here, boss!

ALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the 
platform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the 
genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid.  
All of them are living nightmares.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Oh my God...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS
</b>
CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her 
tiny bathroom-cubicle.  A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the 
corridor outside.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Shit.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
</b>
THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.  As they race swiftly down 
the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A 
particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind 
them.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the 
outside of a module towards them.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>De Vries!

DE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid 
burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death 
throes. 

The group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them 
is parked KAMEN's crawler.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>Inside, inside!

They scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the 
driver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth.  
THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Yo' momma, boneface!

DE VRIES   (to Guttierez)
C'mon, man; punch this cow!

GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.  They keys are there.  He flips 
them, and the engine GROWLS to life.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK
</b>
<b>PREDATOR-VISION.
</b>From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running 
across the platform...

Crouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a 
panel on the small container balanced on his knee.  Inside it are rows 
of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them.  
BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the 
medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet.

Standing around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have 
their camouflage cloaks activated.  The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the 
station draws their attention...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
HIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down 
a field of covering fire on full-automatic.  The blaze of light from 
the rifle's barrel abruptly stops.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What?

<b>KAMEN
</b>I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!

HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.  A field of cows being 
slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.

<b>HIROKO
</b>They're in with the rhino!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK
</b>
An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, 
broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.  It's 
yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED 
BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature.

ALIEN stingers slice through the air.  Rhinos try to bolt but are 
intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.  It's wholesale carnage.

<b>PREDATOR-VISION.
</b>We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below, 
lessening the distance with each second...

Several indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy 
within the ALIENS' ranks.  The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the 
PREDATORS join battle against them...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
An ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's 
roof.

<b>INT.  CRAWLER - DUSK
</b>
KER-CHUNK!  The cab's occupants react as the thin roof buckles 
slightly. Skeletal fingers SLICE through, RIPPING at the metal like a 
can-opener.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Jesus!

THOMAS raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the 
roof. One of them RICOCHETS off the interior, SHATTERING the 
windscreen.  There's a THUMP from outside...

<b>DE VRIES (CONT'D)
</b>You got 'im!

Their triumph is short-lived.  Globules of yellow acid perforate the 
roof like Swiss cheese, dripping down on them.  GUTTIEREZ floors the 
brakes.  The crawler swings through ninety degrees before SCREECHING to 
a halt. 

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
CASSIE enters admin at a run.  Before, it was empty.  Now it's sheer 
chaos. She shoves her way through dozens of grim-faced people.  PARSONS 
is standing at a console, YELLING into his headset.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Seal everything now!

<b>CASSIE
</b>What's happening?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.

<b>CASSIE
</b>We're what!?

York races in, SHOUTING above the clamor.

<b>YORK
</b>The son-of-bitches got into 'E' wing! They're ripping it apart!

<b>PARSONS
</b>Fuck!  Somebody get over there with some guns!  Now!

CASSIE watches the scene unfolding on the banks of monitors.  PEOPLE 
mouthing unheard words into camera.  Bursts of STATIC.  Fleeting 
glimpses of nightmarish SHAPES darting across the picture...

<b>CASSIE
</b>How many of them are there?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Too many.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
</b>
GUTTIEREZ' group hurriedly exits the crawler.  A cloud of acrid smoke 
rapidly fills the cabin.

DE VRIES   (coughing)
Move it, man!

The dead ALIEN's corpse tumbles through the acid-eaten hole, falling 
into the cab's rear seat and promptly burning through that as well. Not 
far away across the platform, the massive doors to the auto-shop hanger 
are RUMBLING slowly closed...

GUTTIEREZ   (shouting)
Hold the doors, hold the doors!

They don't hear him.  The doors seal with a BOOM of finality.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Over there, on the right!

THOMAS sees the two ALIENS nimbly climbing the platform's edge.  He 
squeezes off about five shots, managing to kill the FIRST ALIEN...

<b>THOMAS
</b>These bastards ain't so tough!

THOMAS looks concernedly at GUTTIEREZ.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Is that thing working?

GUTTIEREZ takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Shit!  The casing's cracked!

DE VRIES rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Use mine.  Channel twenty-six.


<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
Despite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of 
PREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde. 

BROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away 
another attacker.  Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the 
platform.  One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering 
intermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct.  
The two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the 
PREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
</b>
Pumped up with adrenalin, KAMEN reaches an intersection and encounters 
a harrowing tableau.  An ALIEN blocks his way on the other side of a 
corridor bulkhead, holding a STRUGGLING MAN above the floor.  It's 
piston-like tongue shoots into the MAN's skull, spraying gore.

The ALIEN sees KAMEN, and it's mouth twists into a bloody SNARL.  Both 
KAMEN and the ALIEN lunge forward together, but KAMEN's got the edge by 
a split-second.  He STRIKES a bright red switch and the overhead 
pressure bulkhead SLAMS down and locks into place.  His breathing is 
heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
</b>
The two ALIENS THOMAS killed must have been the scout party.  Others 
appear, more cautiously this time...

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Hurry up and figure that thing out, man!

GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic 
microswitches on the headset with his fingernails.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>What?

<b>THOMAS
</b>We've got company!

THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.  He gets off 
one shot, then nothing more happens.  He looks at the counter on the 
side.  It reads 'zero'.

<b>THOMAS (CONT'D)
</b>Shit, I'm dry!  You're up!

DE VRIES raises her rifle.  She aims, and...

<b>CLICK.
</b>
<b>DE VRIES
</b>I'm jammed!

<b>THOMAS
</b>You're what?!

She works the manual slide.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>It's locked solid...

<b>THOMAS
</b>Quick, give me the clip!

DE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.  It falls from her 
hands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a 
second too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good.

<b>THOMAS (CONT'D)
</b>Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
</b>
HIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box 
on the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to 
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window.

KERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes 
under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, 
HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away.  
She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge 
outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously 
raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail.

The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the 
onslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters 
secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It 
HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented 
tail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining 
balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden 
floorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an 
unstoppable killing machine...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Holo on!

Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the 
computer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, 
forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, 
confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, 
bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them.

Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards 
the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this 
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO 
GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength...

She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does 
the job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks 
there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat 
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged 
weapon...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
</b>
HIROKO reels into the outside corridor.  She SHRIEKS as her shoulders 
are seized from behind...

<b>KAMEN
</b>Come on!

HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor.

<b>HIROKO
</b>That's the wrong way!

<b>KAMEN
</b>Detour.  Other way's blocked...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
</b>
Back outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.  DE VRIES 
turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>You got any slugs left?

GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Yeah.  Uh...

DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.  GUTTIEREZ completes his 
sentence.

<b>GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
</b>...Seven.

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.  She 
sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical 
storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires...

A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity 
into a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, 
remaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples 
across the platform...

<b>THOMAS
</b>Yes!

Their victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously 
forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can 
clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Try again, man...

The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct 
channel. He YELLS into it...

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Matt!  Open these damn doors right now, I'll ream your ass so bad these 
things out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison!  Swear to 
God!

THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Open the doors!  Open the goddamned fucking doors!

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  CLICK.  GUTTIEREZ' bullets are gone.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>That's it!  We're dead!

The first of the ALIENS rushes at them.  This is the end.  DE VRIES 
<b>SCREAMS...
</b>
There's a blinding flash, and most of the ALIEN's head vaporises.  
GUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted 
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN 
antagonists.  Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-
tech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans' sears the air...

GUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly 
open. Just enough for them to get through.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Move!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
</b>
THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly 
following.

The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one 
wall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the 
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on 
a hydraulic platform.  A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the 
doorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms.  A blonde surfer-
type with long straggly
hair rushes over to them.  This is MATT, their savior.

<b>MATT
</b>Close it up, close it up!

GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up.  
In the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle 
tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents.  It's like a scene out of 
Hell.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
</b>
Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as 
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command 
Center.  KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Hurry it up.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Don't wait for me!

HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command 
Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from 
the rear.  The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently 
from beneath.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Run!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK 
and everybody else in admin.  He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe, and 
what he sees makes his eyes bug.

<b>YORK
</b>Jesus Christ!

He SHOUTS back into the crowded room.

<b>YORK (CONT'D)
</b>They're inside, inside the corridor!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR
</b>
HIROKO and KAMEN try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken 
steel that emerges in their wake.  KAMEN YELLS with fright as an ALIEN 
claw pinions his ankle.  He trashes about, clutching at anything to 
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor.  CRYING OUT is pain as 
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands...

HIROKO  (anguished)
No!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
YORK stands frozen at the bulkhead frame, staring down the corridor in 
horror.  CASSIE races up and pushes him out of the way...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR
</b>
HIROKO looks furiously around.  Spying an emergency axe in it's wall 
housing, she SMASHES the glass with her elbow, cutting herself in the 
process.  HIROKO hefts the heavy tool, swinging it down onto the 
disappearing ALIEN's carapace with all her might...

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Bastard!

The blade bites deep, and yellow blood bursts from the threshing 
ALIEN's wound.  Speckles of it dot KAMEN's leg, eating through the 
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath.  He 
SCREAMS, a sound of pure intense pain...

HIROKO hurls the axe aside.  She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole 
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit.  
There's a SPARKING, followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME.  CASSIE 
steps through into the corridor, just as valves evenly-spaced along the 
length of the tunnel open up, jetting white high-density foam under 
extreme pressure.  The hatch to the Command Center at the far end 
begins to close...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Cassie...!

CASSIE's head shoots around.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
YORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it 
into the narrowing divide.  CASSIE squeezes through the gap and 
urgently HOLLERS to HIROKO...

<b>CASSIE
</b>It you don't... uh!... move your ass, you're gonna need a helluva diet 
to get through here!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
from CASSIE's P.O.V. we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him 
along.  Foam fills three-quarters of the corridor to their rear and is 
nearly up to their knees everywhere else.  The chair's frame CREAKS 
ominously in protest...

<b>YORK
</b>Hurry up, we're losing it!

CASSIE's eyes widen in terror...

<b>CASSIE
</b>Behind you!

HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge 
momentarily from out of the foam.  Something yanks at KAMEN and he 
disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Kamen!

HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags 
her away.

<b>CASSIE
</b>It's too late!

<b>HIROKO
</b>Nooooo!

The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself...

<b>YORK
</b>It's going!

With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.  YORK 
vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER 
closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only 
three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK.

A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in 
flight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into 
the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors 
WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body...
<b> 
</b>The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too 
long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The 
shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and 
CLATTERS to the floor.

The PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his 
wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but 
gets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The 
PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight 
through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer 
in the process.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed 
disbelief.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Miss Noguchi?

No reaction.  He tries again.

<b>PARSONS (CONT'D)
</b>Miss Noguchi!

HIROKO snaps out of it.  She crosses over to the bank of monitoring 
screens.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What's the story?

PARSONS runs through each of the screens.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', 
and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally 
evacuate.

<b>HIROKO
</b>How many... how many people are missing?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over 
the place.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What's our weapons situation?

DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We 
got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Auto-shop?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Has anybody talked to them?

<b>CASSIE
</b>Not yet.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Do it.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK
</b>
BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a 
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.  Back-to-back, they take up 
fighting positions.  A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS 
arrives.

Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. 
Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's 
hand-to-hand...and nothing else.

It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.  BROKEN TUSK takes 
flight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an 
ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with 
lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures 
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of 
the modules.  Caught like flies in a spider's web.  Both thrash about, 
severing cables as they do.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the 
air...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and 
the bank of monitors turn to static.  There's an instant of silence 
collective concerns amongst those gathered there.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>What the hell...?

<b>PARSONS
</b>Don't panic, people.  We've just switched over to internals.

<b>HIROKO
</b>They knocked out the external feeds.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Looks like it.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Thirty six hours?

PARSONS nods.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Give or take.

<b>CASSIE
</b>We're not gonna make it, are we?

<b>HIROKO
</b>Get the auto-shop on-line.

PARSONS shakes his head.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk.  
That's down with the other feeds.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Well... try the headset.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
</b>
Spirits are low in the auto-shop.

<b>MATT
</b>I'm tellin' you, it's impossible.  Nothing can grow and reproduce this 
fast.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Yeah.  Right.  You wanna go outside and tell them that?

<b>DE VRIES
</b>What's keeping those fucking Marines, man? They should'a been here by 
now!

THOMAS lashes out at an empty can, kicking it noisily across the floor.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Maybe they ain't coming.  Maybe they don't even know we've got 
problems...

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>I don't wanna hear that kind of crap, Thomas.  They're coming.  Just a 
matter of time, that's all...

GUTTIEREZ' headset lies nearby.  PARSONS muted VOICE comes out of it.  
One of the GREASE MONKEY's snatches it up and listens.

<b>GREASE MONKEY
</b>Yo!  Guttierez!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
<b>PARSONS
</b>Through now.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Jan, it's Hiroko.  What sort of shape are you in down there?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speaker)
Pretty damn good shape, considering.  You can tell Don Kamen from me 
his people have got balls of steel.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Kamen didn't make it, Jan.

There's a pregnant PAUSE from the speakers.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Jan?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Yeah.  I... we're still here.  We're all... uh... all sorry to hear 
that.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Can you make it back?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Uh... I'd say that was a negative.  If we open the doors, those things 
are gonna swarm inside.  There's another problem, too.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What's that?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on 
the way in here.  Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up, 
but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Oh, man...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... 
there's got to be a way out of this.

<b>YORK
</b>Oh yeah?  Like what?

YORK's kept quiet, but everyone turns to him now.  His tone is scathing 
and cuts to the marrow.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Well, what about those other things outside; those warriors?  Maybe we 
can cut some kind of deal...

YORK looks around at them in incredulous disbelief.

</b>
MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are 
on him.

<b>MATT
</b>Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load 
the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a 
bit of distance...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
MATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)
...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell 
arrive.

<b>HIROKO
</b>That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for 
remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and 
running.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Which mean physically going outside.

DRISCOLL looks around uneasily.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Yeah.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK
</b>
A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are 
clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor.  
HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across 
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a 
pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Is this the suit?

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Uh-huh.

She takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls 
it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his 
face.

<b>YORK
</b>This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform 
on foot!

<b>CASSIE
</b>Shut up, York.

<b>HIROKO
</b>No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here?

A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice.

<b>REDHEADED GIRL
</b>I have.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Let me have the keys.

The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts 
them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Which one is it?

<b>REDHEADED GIRL
</b>Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes.

<b>YORK
</b>Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous...

<b>HIROKO
</b>Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it 
gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset.

CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO 
fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom.

HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>How much air-time have I got?

<b>CASSIE
</b>About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to 
admire the scenery.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Deal.

<b>CASSIE
</b>We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into 
the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the 
inside of the glass as you go.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the 
helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Sounds great.

<b>PARSONS
</b>It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll 
be going in blind.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What?  Why?

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits 
you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around 
reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights 
would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down 
there oughta be enough to do the trick.

<b>HIROKO
</b>How tight are these shafts?

CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running 
into any Aliens.

HIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead.  
PARSONS nods.

<b>PARSONS
</b>There's still time to back-out.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do 
myself.  Where's the disk?

PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Don't lose it.

HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Don't worry.  I won't.

DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Here.  If you got to use 'em, make 'em count.

They're magazines for her gun.  She slots them into the bandolier.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Thanks.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it 
straight.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and 
press the green enabling button...

PARSONS   (interrupting)
No.  There's two of them.

She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...

<b>PARSONS
</b>Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of 
there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke 
some kind of response.

YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool.

<b>YORK
</b>You'll need this for the gratings. Trigger finger to operate, thumb 
button to switch over to the rivet gun.  The sensors'll choose blade or 
socket heads automatically.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Right.   (long beat)   Okay, I'm set.

YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's 
head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar.  
PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the 
connections. 

<b>PARSONS
</b>Alright, let's open her up.  Carefully, now...

CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily 
at a fixed point on the ground.  Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the 
pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating.  It's identical to the one 
DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier.  A plume of pressurised gas jets 
into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free.  CASSIE 
scrutinizes her tracker...

<b>CASSIE
</b>All clear...

HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one 
side.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open 
shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim.  Superimposed lines of 
glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid 
duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form.  A flatly-
synthesised male

COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four...

HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening.  
She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension.  Tries to 
reassure herself.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Okay.  Okay.

She looks around at the impassive, staring faces.  Summoning up her 
courage, she submerges the helmet...

<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.
</b>The pale illumination of the lower level deck-lights gives way to 
absolute nothingness; a stygian nightmare.  She SHUDDERS with horror 
and pulls her head free.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Oh...!  Oh, God...

She WIPES frenetically at the slickly-coated visor, breathing heavily. 
Worried hands grab her.

<b>CASSIE
</b>Are you alright?

<b>PARSONS
</b>What?  What's wrong?  What is it?

HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes.  She swallows hard and 
calms down.

<b>HIROKO
</b>It's alright.  I'm okay.

Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into 
the water once more...

HIROKO's P.O.V.
Everything goes to blackness again.  The head-up-display presents a 
view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four 
slash eleven...

YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Seal it.

The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned 
over the hole.  YORK shakes his head.

<b>YORK
</b>Suicide run, man.  Fuckin' suicide run.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT
</b>
CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.  It's only about half-
again as wide as HIROKO.  The only illumination comes from the hazy 
circle above.  As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone.

Something flickers.  Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the 
murk with a faint orange haze.

CASSIE   (O.S. on speakers)
All the comforts of home.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Thanks, Cassie.

CASSIE   (O.S., on speakers)
Don't mention it.

She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing 
heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is 
overwhelming in the  silence...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT
</b>
The station's massive antenna array is being transformed.  Otherworldly 
shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to 
cover it's surface.  ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams 
of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs.  
They're building a nest of staggering proportions.

Unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the 
crane catwalk high above...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
</b>
BROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks 
lighting his face.  He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer 
with an intricate tool.  He removes it and presses a switch.  The 
display glows briefly, then fades.  He inserts it again.  Electrical 
sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out.  
BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
</b>
From our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS 
sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.  He GRUNTS as he pulls a 
valve on the crawler's underside.

Across the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of 
the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on.

<b>GREASE MONKEY
</b>Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more...

He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.

<b>GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D)
</b>Whoa...shit!

The man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the 
floor. Scowls first, then frowns.  It's sticky.

Over near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.  DE VRIES is 
nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his 
helmet.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>She just set off!

MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's 
attention.

<b>MATT
</b>Okay, people.  Let's hustle...

There's a SCREAM from behind.  They wheel around in time to see the 
GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.  THOMAS yells 
down from the platform.

<b>THOMAS
</b>They're comin' up through the pit!

A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the 
ceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, 
making the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring 
about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, 
CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens.

An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the 
nearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Over there!

One of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine-
block suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release-
catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains 
RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look 
up, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into 
the creature, flattening it instantly.

Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the 
platform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the 
face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The 
LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets 
THOMAS' attention.

<b>THOMAS
</b>Mother-fucker!

THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The 
ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering 
THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body 
and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up.

The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. 
THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH 
of the blade, a peculiar sound...

The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.  Like a metallic 
snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame.

Straight at THOMAS.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

HIROKO elbows her way further through the cramped water-filled duct.  A 
wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Green neon flashes in her display, with accompanying 
notations.

CASSIE's VOICE is a little less clear now, with traces of STATIC 
drifting in...

CASSIE  (O.S., on speakers)
Copy that.  Be careful, now.

<b>HIROKO
</b>You betcha.

She places the tip of her power-tool over the first of the grille's 
anchoring bolts.  The complex mechanism WHINES as it selects the 
correct wrench-tip for the job...

THOMAS is laid-out in the back seat of the crawler's cab, with DE VRIES

to his chest.  GUTTIEREZ speaks into his headset mike.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Rob?  We got problems.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER

THUMP.  THUMP.  SLAM!  The grille in knocked out of it's housing and 
floats lazily off into the water.  HIROKO passes through the newly-
created hole.

<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
</b>She finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber, about five feet in 
height.  Massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor 
and ceiling ought to be.  Kicking up a swirl of particles.  Pale blue 
light filters down from above.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Caution!  Entering secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven.

swirls around her as she brings the power-tool up once more.

HIROKO's pulls her third bolt free.  It drifts slowly downward, 
slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine.

A fragmented VOICE comes through on her headset, distorted beyond 
recognition.  HIROKO's forehead knits together in concentration and 
annoyance.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What was that?  I don't copy.

CLICK.  CLICK.  BEEP!  The routine sound of the motion tracker changes 
suddenly.  HIROKO turns her attention from the task-in-hand to study 
the tracker's helmet readout.  THREE NEBULOUS BLOBS have appeared from 
off-screen.  Heading straight for her position.

</b>I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Keep trying!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER
</b>
BEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  The signals pick-up speed the closer they get.  
CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.  She looks 
wildly around the chamber.  The only way out the way she came in...

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate 
access to...

HIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.  The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, 
while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume.  
Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her...

HIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.  It's position makes it 
virtually impossible to get back into.  She tries anyhow.

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!  A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, 
flattening her against the wall.  DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other 
side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from 
HIROKO.  She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor 
screen recede and finally disappear.  The tracker's pitch returns to 
it's hollow CLICKING.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
BROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through 
the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.  He finds 
something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side.  
He turns it carefully over in his hands.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
</b>
HIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime 
adhering to her helmet.  Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes 
the mucus away...

<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
</b>She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel 
some eighteen feet in diameter.  The water-level comes up about half-
way.  What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion...

She's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.  Glued into the 
curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS.  
Other ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are 
comatose, twitching occasionally.  Every square inch not containing 
bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.  It's like Hell for real.

HIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout. 

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
...Brrzzt.  Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi 
dust DS two-six.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several 
feet away.  Under the surface.  She wades swiftly through the water, 
passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.  A large 
PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.  It 
might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell.

HIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the 
power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!  There's the first 
one, no problem.  BZZZZ...BZZZZ!  The second and third are just as 
easy.  She goes for the fourth.  BZZZ...CHUNK.  Nothing happens.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Come on...

She bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny 
green LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A 
malfunction.

COMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate 
access to  venturi ducts.

There's only one recourse left to her.  She jams down the thumb 
button...

KER-SLAM!  The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her 
internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.  She wipes the 
slime from her helmet yet again...

...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in 
four neat sections.  The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... 

...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery 
dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates 
itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself 
back toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO 
raises the power-tool,
reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP 
through the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's 
surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives 
into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt.

BZZZZ!  It's out!  She levers-off the grille.  Forces herself into the 
confined space beyond...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT
</b>
Another poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes 
upwards on a diagonal slope.  HIROKO braces herself against the walls 
and begins to climb.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speaker)
Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface.

WHAM!  An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.  It's 
claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.  She grits 
her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent.
<b> 
</b>WALLPO!  It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.  She tries 
frantically to gain purchase on anything.  She fails.  The ALIEN draws 
her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture 
lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts 
to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass.

HIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger.  
Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A 
haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, 
coughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with 
all her might.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
Internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork.  
It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.  HIROKO hauls herself from the 
shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She 
throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks 
desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment 
off.

As promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts 
towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the 
ruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through 
the smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws 
the keys.

SLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO 
scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears 
across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines 
ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the 
powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp.  
Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck.

HIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire 
over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and-
orange smoke rising into the air.
<b> 
</b>A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet 
another ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the 
hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant.
<b> 
</b>HIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see-
sawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, 
crawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both 
throttles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a 
halt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the 
surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls 
it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the 
leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising 
creature, neatly decapitating it. 

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT
</b>
The hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO 
dismounts and draws her pistol.  Takes in the sheer height of the 
ladder she's going to have to scale.  Thumbs her headset. 

<b>HIROKO
</b>Okay, I make it to the crane.  You...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the 
speakers.

HIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speakers)
...Can all uncross your fingers.

A WHOOP goes up.  Various hands are SLAPPED.

<b>PARSONS
</b>We copy, boss.  Nice going.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE LADDER - NIGHT

HIROKO's climbing the ladder.  She stops to catch her breath.

</b>
HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)

</b>Driscoll; you're up.

DRISCOLL's moving even as PARSONS speaks.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>I hear you...

<b>EXT.  RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the 
Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of 
the handrail.  If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have 
seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL
</b>
DRISCOLL flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder-well.  
Printed on the inside is a set of instructions, with the following 
printed boldly in red;

<b>CAUTION!  EXPLOSIVE BOLTS - READ CAREFULLY!
</b>
He traces his finger along a line of text.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO enters the cab at a run.  She flips a row of switches, and the 
control board comes to life.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Access panel... access panel...

She finds it.  Gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out.  
Beneath is a mini-disk drive with two buttons.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Bingo.

She pulls the vinyl-wrapped packet from her catsuit pocket.  Carefully 
withdraws the disk and slides it home.  Thumbs the first button, which 
glows an emerald green.

The board's flatscreen monitor lights up immediately.  HIROKO studies 
it for a moment, then presses her headset link.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Okay, we're in business.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP - CRAWLER CAB

Everybody from Auto-shop is crammed into the two articulated vehicles. 
GUTTIEREZ sits in the driver's seat of the first crawler.  He glances 
out of the side window.  MATT gives him a 'thumbs-up' from the cab of 
the second crawler.

GUTTIEREZ   (into headset)
Say the word, and you won't see our asses for dust.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

HIROKO wipes a trickle of sweat from her forehead.  She poises her 
finger over the second drive-button.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Alright.  Here we go...

</b>
Everybody in admin looks tense.

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)

GUTTIEREZ leans forward.

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on headset)
Two...

HIROKO blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>One...mark!

She stabs the drive switch.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE - NIGHT

Smoothly maintained engineering comes to life.  The enormous yellow 
crane starts to move on it's track-rails.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

The control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and 
schematics...

<b>HIROKO

<b>PARSONS
</b>Blow those suckers, Driscoll!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip 
on the end.  Slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully 
turns it.  A tiny red LED comes on.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE
</b>
Complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting 
pier-platforms.  There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car 
engines misfiring.  Explosive bolts release the tethers.

</b>
DRISCOLL reports into his headset.

<b>DRISCOLL
</b>Bolts blown!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the 
PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her 
foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her 
hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for 
a moment...

<b>HIROKO
</b>No!

...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side.  
Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She 
reaches out for it...

<b>INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB

GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up 
display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to 
<b>'DRIVE'.

The two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights 
blazing.

GUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards 
the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Shit!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
KER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway 
and through the platform safety barrier.  It balances precariously for 
a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in 
a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE.

<b>MATT
</b>Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby!

Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the 
gigantic crane moving against the night sky.

<b>PREDATOR VISION.  
</b>Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good 
enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.

The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN 
TUSK's attention.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring 
herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She 
brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her 
fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
The two crawlers plunge into the curtain of flames spreading across the 
platform.

<b>INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT
</b>
DE VRIES YELLS at GUTTIEREZ over the ROAR of the flames.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Hotter 'n hell out there!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the 
platform.  She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away.  
With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports, 
which automatically WHIRR closed.  Gropes for the ignition key...

Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves.  SCRAPING across the 
concrete.  ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's 
manta wings.  She's parked the bike over a drainage exit!

HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine.  The white-hot downblast from 
the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS.  The vehicle 
tilts and KICKS forward.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
The two crawlers emerge from the conflagration, scorched and trailing 
fire. In the BACKGROUND, the crane-hoist centers over the admin module.

<b>CATWALK P.O.V., 
</b>looking straight down.  Four lasers scan quickly around the module's 
edges.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
</b>
A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen:
<b>POSITIVE MATCH.  COMMENCE LIFTING OPERATION.
</b>
<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
The sound of SHREDDING METAL makes HIROKO look down.  An ALIEN is 
hanging on the underside of the bike!  She twists the throttle, 
reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches.  
Sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the 
roadway.  The ALIEN's determination is astounding.  It's tail SLAMS up 
through the alloy 'wing', anchoring it.

The biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up, shifting the bike's center 
of gravity.  She fights the controls, but finds herself swerving.  One-
handed, she takes aim.  BLAM!  BLAM!  She misses the ALIEN, rupturing a 
fuel pipe instead.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
The crane's clamping mechanism closes around the admin module, locking 
into place.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
CLANG!  Everybody reacts as the SOUND penetrates through the walls and 
ECHOES around admin.

<b>PARSONS
</b>Okay, people.  Hold on tight...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Pencils, disposable cups, and anything else not bolted down all roll 
from table-tops.  Most are grabbed by their owners.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO's bike veers blindly around the corner of a building, with 
HIROKO still SHOOTING.  She looks up and her eyes widen.  Ahead is the 
out-of-control blaze.  A tongue of flame licks out across the platform, 
directly in her path.

HIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for 
cover behind the bike's windshield.  The ALIEN's head twists around, 
and they plunge into the inferno...

WHOOMPH!  The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume 
of yellow flame.  HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the 
steering bar hard to the right.  She leaps for safety as the burning 
bike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety-
rail and plummets into the swamp.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM RAMP - NIGHT
</b>
The two crawlers THUNDER down the ramp.  GUTTIEREZ' vehicle pulls into 
a tight right turn, while MATT's continues on it's course.  The crane 
with it's underslug module continues to RUMBLE slowly forward. 

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway.  Winces. 
Something hurts.  She looks down at the back of her left hand.  The 
skin has been scraped away. 

A DISTANT NOISE, something else being broken.  HIROKO turns.  Through 
the conflagration, ALIENS are advancing.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ turns his head to one of the guys in the rear. 

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Take the wheel, Roy!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry.  The moment 
they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone.  DE VRIES is alert, 
the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>C'mon, man!  Let's shag it!

GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's 
cab.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand.  
She thumbs her headset.

HIROKO's VOICE interrupts.

HIROKO   (O.S., on speakers)
I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off.

HIROKO spins around the corner, pointing her gun cop-stance.

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's 
cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control 
fascia pointing out-back.  DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides 
into the rear.  She flicks on an overhead light.  Taped to one side is 
a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder.
<b> 
</b><b>DE VRIES
</b>Nice buns...

She gives the control board a cursory once-over.  GUTTIEREZ calls back 
from his vantage point at the doorway.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Can you handle it?

DE VRIES powers-up the console.

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Piece of cake.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet.  The flicker of an 
andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face...the disappears.

Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of 
the grounded machine.  It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to 
raise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby 
navigation tower... straight for her.

HIROKO turns tail.  She races over to a ladder running up the side of a 
building and begins to climb.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

<b>DE VRIES
</b>Couple more seconds!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like 
a pack of dogs.  She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with 
ease. So do the ALIENS.

She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the 
main street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the 
other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops 
thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something 
red.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to 
the building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch.  
Glances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the 
primer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and 
turns...

She's practically on top of the bolts.  The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING.  
With the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street 
with a SCREECH of twisted metal.  One of the ALIENS is pulverized by 
the falling debris, but the others survive.  All HIROKO's managed to do 
is buy herself some breathing space...

She races across the building's roof.  Reaches the other 
side...straight into a dead end.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

The admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying 
CLUNK.  Autocouplers slot into place, and the crane releases it's load.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The connecting jolt is even greater then before.  Several larger 
objects CRASH to the deck.

<b>INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
</b>
<b>DE VRIES
</b>That's it!  We've got it!  Get us out of here.

GUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS.  He pulls the cab door 
shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat.

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>C'mon sweetheart.  Do your stuff...

<b>EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT

Bertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under 
it's treads...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO's P.O.V.  It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with 
no ladders or any other way down.  She looks desperately around for 
another avenue of escape.

The leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.  HIROKO 
swings her pistol over and fires.  It falls away...only to be replaced 
seconds later by two others.

Her gun goes dry.  Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine.  
She slaps the spare in and continues firing.

<b>INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
</b>
Big Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees. 
GUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches. 

<b>GUTTIEREZ
</b>Get down!

DE VRIES hits the floor.  The thick boughs impact with the cab, 
SHATTERING the safety glass.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  CLICK.  HIROKO's gun's empty.  She reaches 
for another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last 
one.

The encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.  With no place to 
go, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.  The lead 
ALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.  It's almost on her.  HIROKO 
<b>CRIES OUT...
</b>
WHOOSH!  The ALIEN's face is severed in half.  A circular metal object 
blurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the 
human eye can follow.  A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO, 
pushing her out of the way.  She hits the deck hard and gasps.  BROKEN 
TUSK is standing before her.  He skillfully catches the frisbee-like 
'smart weapon', then
throws it again.

HIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the 
ALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable 
fighting  technique.  Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by 
advanced PREDATOR weaponry.  Acidic blood flows freely.  The skirmish 
is surprisingly brief.

BROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.  BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung 
metal rod from his shoulder.  Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming 
a spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.  It takes a 
second for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.  Bewildered, she 
accepts it, pulling herself up.

A bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of 
their attentions.  BROKEN TUSK regards her.  His mandibles CLICK-CLACK 
nervously... 

<b>HIROKO
</b>Look.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry 
coming to my rescue... they never looked like you.

The PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.

HIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands. 

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Broken.  Useless!

She throws it aside.  BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard.  
Another DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Jesus.  I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place.

She SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Come on, Butch.  Let's go.

She begins to walk away.  BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier, 
peering over the side...

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Hey!  I said come on!

The PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.  He gauges the distance below, 
then throws himself off the platform's edge.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>What...?

She races across to the rail and gazes downward.

<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.
</b>The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see.  
HIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Shit!

She crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
HIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK 
has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform 
piers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is 
underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water.  
The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from 
within.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there!

No joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Hey!

BROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears 
into the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last 
person left alive here.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Goddammit!

She takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows...

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT
</b>
HIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers.  
It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the 
maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. 

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly)
Wha...?

BROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the 
message.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
</b>
They exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds 
herself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the 
water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of 
them look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC 
HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS 
PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they 
travel.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
They come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by 
an enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything.

HIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast 
mechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around 
it. She seems to be asleep.

BROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of 
forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what 
he's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's 
stomach blown open.

HIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped 
around several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered 
here-and-there.

BROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic 
fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The 
bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the 
entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of 
secreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates 
it.

The SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN.  
It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves...

BROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN 
settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes 
his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the 
'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He 
withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to 
work...

DOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in 
slime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her 
eyes are wide as she turns...

It's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he 
speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering.

<b>KAMEN
</b>Hiroko...

HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE.

UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip 
of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display 
illuminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the 
readout begins to blink...

BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.

<b>KAMEN (CONT'D)
</b>They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I 
don't...remember what happened next.

<b>HIROKO
</b>What can I do?

<b>KAMEN
</b>I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.

<b>HIROKO
</b>I... I can't!

<b>KAMEN
</b>You have to...

<b>HIROKO
</b>No!

BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm.  
<b>SCHNICK! 
</b>The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale 
face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
</b>
BROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a 
nearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to 
spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting 
through the EGG and it's writhing contents.

The two of them reach the deep end and have to wade.  HIROKO pushes 
herself along the biomechanical outcropping.  Ahead of them is the 
PULSING SAC. Before they're even passed beneath it, they hear 
SOMETHING.  A SOUND like water-filled balloons hitting wet concrete.
<b> 
</b>The SAC ruptures, spattering thick gloopy matter.  A form comprised of  
slender limbs emerges from within.  An IMMATURE QUEEN ALIEN.  Though 
just-born, it's reflexes are razor-sharp.  It lashes out at HIROKO and 
BROKEN TUSK.  HIROKO ducks, and the QUEEN's claws embed themselves in 
BROKEN TUSK's shoulder, destroying his automatic cannon.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
</b>
A VAST EXPLOSION rips through the base, broiling clouds of flame 
rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts. 

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
Columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the Pump Chamber, 
rippling across the adult QUEEN ALIEN and her hapless victims.  She 
begins to SCREAM, flailing around atop her metal throne... 

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
</b>
The adult QUEEN's SHRIEK echoes through the reservoir, accompanied by a 
ball of fire that travels part of the way down.  The IMMATURE QUEEN 
turns her head in reply, answering with her own YOWL.

BROKEN TUSK HISSES with hate, and brings his 'smart weapon' SLICING 
down through her arm, severing it at the wrist.  HIROKO simultanesouly 
DRIVES her spear into the ALIEN's chest.  She grabs the injured 
PREDATOR and pulls him away from the thrashing creature.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Come on!  Come on!

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
The alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably 
count down...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The metal plug HIROKO blew during her earlier escape still lies to one 
side of the duct HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK crawl hastily out of.  
Fireballs are erupting all around now, making their situation 
precarious. 

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
</b>
From a vantage point high above, we see HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK racing 
across the platform towards the heli-jet pad. 

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK stumbles and falls.  HIROKO bends down to help him up, but 
the PREDATOR shoves her away.  He doesn't want her assistance.

<b>HIROKO
</b>If you don't move your ugly butt, we're gonna end up barbecued!  Come 
on!

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
</b><b> 
</b>HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet, with the PREDATOR close 
behind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles 
designed to deflect downward exhaust gases.  HIROKO's feet CLATTER 
across the metal...

KER-SMASH!  The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her.  
The IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has 
got the jump on them.  HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to 
stop running...she's too close.  Almost at the last moment, she jumps.  
claws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air.  She hits the deck 
and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper.

BROKEN TUSK stops.  ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of 
nearby drainage ducts.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO slips into the chopper's pilot seat.  She flips a bunch of 
switches and the turbines RISE in VOLUME from a LOW WHINE to a DULL 
<b>ROAR. 
</b>
<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
</b>
An orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind BROKEN TUSK.  With the 
ALIENS blocking his path, there's no refuge for him. Almost.  The 
Navigation Tower looms overhead, nearby.  BROKEN TUSK takes a 
calculated risk and LEAPS for it.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The heli-jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter.  HIROKO 
pulls-back on the collective, and the turbines' pitch changes from a 
THROATY GROWL to a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The heli-jet rises, a little unsteadily.  The wash from the turbines 
plays across the SHRIEKING ALIENS.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Through the canopy dome, we see BROKEN TUSK climbing 
the Navigation Tower, with the ALIENS close behind.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Okay, Butch.  I can play cavalry, too...

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can.  As the top of the 
tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array.

The IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is 
almost upon him.  The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat 
of a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing.  It CRASHES into 
the QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork.  She 
HISSES, lashing out at the creature.  Sends it hurtling to the ground.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK makes it to the top.  There's not much space on the catwalk 
to maneuver.  He looks around, then down.  This is his last stand. 
Instinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct 
computer. Of course, it's not there.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
The third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear.  
Time's running out...fast.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.  A BLAST 
of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.  He turns...

HIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the 
tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.  She HOLLERS at 
the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines.

<b>HIROKO
</b>C'mon!  Jump!

BROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option 
available to him.  He jumps.

THWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, 
it's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and 
through the door as...

...KER-BLAM!  A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the 
storage tanks below ignite.  The shock wave buffets the chopper against 
the tower.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK's P.O.V.
The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli-
jet is propelled towards the metal structure.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
CRUNCH!  The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their 
handholds.  One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around 
the port engine mount.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO pushes on the stick.  The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts 
violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it 
slowly down.  In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly 
collapse.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Shit!

BROKEN TUSK turns towards her.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>In the back!  In the back!

The PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the 
frantic jerking of her hand.  He twists around to look in the chopper's 
rear.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.  The 
conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand.

<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.  He quickly takes 
stock of it.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Watch your shots!  If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell!

BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.  His index finger won't slide into 
the trigger guard...it's too big!  He takes the guard in both hands and 
exerts pressure.  SNAP.  Problem solved.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
BLEEP!  There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's 
display counter.

<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
A red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.  She must sense it 
somehow. Her head comes round to bear...

BROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her.

<b>BROKEN TUSK
</b>Chew...on...this...!

BLAM!  A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.  She YOWLS.  
BLAM! A second round does the job.  The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and 
falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below.

<b>INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
</b>
The last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.  We 
hear a

<b>HIGH-PITCHED TONE.
</b>
<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO throws the joystick forward.

<b>EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The heli-jet accelerates hell-for-leather away.  An incandescent BALL 
OF ENERGY expands outward, vaporising the station and most of the 
surrounding bayou for about a mile's radius.

<b>EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Big Bertha's parked by the blinking blue beacon tower, site of the ill-
fated hunting expedition.  About a dozen or so people are milling 
around, smoking cigarettes or talking.

MATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler.  
They feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward.

Their P.O.V. 
Above the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon...

<b>MATT
</b>Holy shit!

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the 
turbulence out.

<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
A chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the 
chopper's starboard engine.  There's a BURST of flame, then the 
extinguishers cut in.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height 
rapidly.

<b>HIROKO
</b>We've lost the starboard engine!  We're going down!  Hold on!

<b>EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls.  
The glass cracks with the impact.

<b>HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
</b>Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through 
the canopy of foliage.

<b>EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH, 
spraying mud all around.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The canopy implodes.  A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit, 
spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.  She SCREAMS.

<b>EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The chopper comes to rest in the swamp.  The SQUAWKING of the local 
WILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down.

<b>INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
</b>
HIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.  There's a nasty gash across her 
forehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.  The door frame on his side is 
buckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end 
impaling him through the shoulder.  The PREDATOR coughs luminous green 
blood.

<b>HIROKO
</b>We've gotta get you out of here.

<b>EXT.  SWAMP - DAWN
</b>
The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to 
the other side.  She manages to get the mangled door open.  BROKEN 
TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.

<b>HIROKO (CONT'D)
</b>Hold on.  This is gonna hurt some.

HIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.  The PREDATOR braces 
himself, and starts to move.  The agony is excruciating; his mandibles 
open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR.

HIROKO helps him out of the seat.  The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his 
feet. What happens next is totally unexpected.

BROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.  Shocked, HIROKO 
gets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.  She looks up.

The ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's 
sledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements.

The PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying 
blade-down in the mire.  HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling 
away.  She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her.

The ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents 
face each other like sumo wrestlers.  HIROKO assumes a defensive 
stance, holding the disc ready to strike.  The ALIEN hisses, it's tail 
stinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.  The 
ALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and 
time again.  With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the 
biomechanoid's body.  One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to 
the floor, it's stinger arching towards her.  She parries, slicing the 
tail in half and struggling to her feet.

The ALIEN strikes again.  HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one 
of it's hands.  The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her 
and sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip.

She's lost, and the creature knows it.  It's lips curl into a SNARL.

KER-POW!  KER-POW!  The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body 
slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK 
pointing the pulse
rifle.

The dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.  HIROKO stumbles across 
to him.  BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from 
it's throat.  It gazes up at HIROKO.

<b>BROKEN TUSK
</b>Not...a pretty...sight...

And with that, the PREDATOR dies.

HIROKO look around.  The sun is rising above the treetops, and the 
setting is serene.  Somehow beautiful.

The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her.

VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Rimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp 
Battalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell.  
Please respond.  Over.

There's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP.  HIROKO surveys the horizon.

HIROKO's P.O.V.  
A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their 
weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the 
ground far below.

A shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun.  A monstrous SHAPE 
occupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration.  The 
PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing 
gear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper.

HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out.  BROKEN TUSK's body is 
borne aloft and carried back inside.  The LEAD PREDATOR turns to 
HIROKO.  He crosses to her.  HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted 
eyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet.

The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear.  KER-CHUNK!  
The tips lock into place.  The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO.  She 
accepts, a little confused.

There's a long moment.  The PREDATOR is still standing there.  Waiting. 
HIROKO's eyes narrow.  Her mind is working furiously.  What do they 
want?

She realises.  It suddenly becomes clear.  She smiles.

<b>HIROKO
</b>Yeah.  Why not.

HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the 
waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back.

The PREDATOR follows her.  The ramp SLAMS closed, as we...

            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot
            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down

                      of appearing and answering to all these
                      false charges. In addition, he is the

            Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade
            is pulled back, allowing entrance...

            Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by
            a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS
            exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

            Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge
            through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 

            Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI

            Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with
            cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)
            reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down...

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

<b>            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO
            REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

            And Jesse is seated beside him.

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:
            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

<b>                                JESSE

                      much blood you want to spill...that's up
                      to you.

            Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

                      up with strychnine? How he died slow
                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

</b>                      Get fucked.

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse
            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose.
